You can use \u0027{}{}{}\u0027.format(...) instead\n\nI\u0027ll look into adding the automation. To manually run it over your file, you can do `python -m pylint --py3k test_integration/geopm_test_launcher.py`.\n\nNote: the python3 version runs faster, so you can launch through python3 instead, if you have pylint installed for it.",
