      "message": "I see. That makes sense now. So we need to use it similar to checking errno? Checking for the state of a present exception is straight-forward. If we want to check for the absence of an error, we need to clear it before starting the operation we want to test.\n\nSo the issues we saw while using pdb were probably just left-over state from an earlier step in getting the debugger to that point the code?",

After I used some more of the tricks we went over yesterday to cache the state of things before dropping into the debugger, I saw that this ValueError exception was in the sys.exc_info() call.  Clearing the exc info fixes behavior where files were kept when the tests passed cleanly.",
