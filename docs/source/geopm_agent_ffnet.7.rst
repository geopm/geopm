geopm_agent_ffnet(7) -- agent for adjusting frequencies based on application behavior
=====================================================================================

Description
-----------

.. note::
    This is currently an experimental agent and is only available when
    building GEOPM with the ``--enable-beta`` flag. The agent is subject
    to change, including being combined with other agents. 

    

The FFNet agent adjusts frequencies per domain for the goal of improved energy
efficiency with minimal performance loss. The agent instantiates a neural net
per domain that ingests hardware telemetry and outputs a probability distribution
of region classes. This probability distribution is used to determine an optimal
per-domain frequency. The agent policy can specify an energy-performance bias which
determines the degree to which the frequency recommender is adverse to potentially
reducing performance by reducing frequency to save energy.

This agent requires a neural net JSON file and a region hint recommender JSON file.
Without these JSON files, the agent will throw an error. These files can be autogenerated
using scripts included in the ``$GEOPM_SOURCE/integration/experiment/ffnet`` 
directory, as described below.

The neural net for region classification must be provided in a JSON configuration
file pointed to by environment variables ``GEOPM_CPU_NN_PATH`` and/or 
``GEOPM_GPU_NN_PATH``, which must comply with the following schema:

.. literalinclude:: ../json_schemas/domainnetmap_neural_net.schema.json
    :language: json

The per-region frequency recommendations must be provided in a JSON configuration
file pointed to by environment variables ``GEOPM_CPU_FMAP_PATH`` and/or 
``GEOPM_GPU_FMAP_PATH``, which must comply with the following schema:

.. literalinclude:: ../json_schemas/regionhintrecommender_fmap.schema.json
    :language: json

If you specify a neural net for a domain (CPU/GPU), you must specify a frequency 
recommendation as well.

This agent can be used at the package scope to control CPU frequency
and/or at the per-GPU scope to control GPU frequency.

Agent Name
----------

The agent described in this manual is selected in many geopm
interfaces with the ``"ffnet"`` agent name.  This name can be
passed to :doc:`geopmlaunch(1) <geopmlaunch.1>` as the argument to the ``--geopm-agent``
option, or the ``GEOPM_AGENT`` environment variable can be set to this
name (see :doc:`geopm(7) <geopm.7>`\ ).  This name can also be passed to the
:doc:`geopmagent(1) <geopmagent.1>` as the argument to the ``'-a'`` option.

Policy Parameters
-----------------

  ``PERF_ENERGY_BIAS`` \:
      A value between [0-1] that determines how aggressively
      the agent will reduce frequency in order to save energy.
      A value of 0 indicates that no performance loss can be
      tolerated, while a value of 1 indicates that energy
      efficiency is paramount. Note that there are no absolute
      guarantees about performance; rather, the general trend
      of performance impact and energy efficiency will be
      monotonic relative to this bias.


Policy Requirements
-------------------

The ``PERF_ENERGY_BIAS`` must be between 0 and 1.

Required JSON Files
--------------------

To generate the neural network and frequency recommendation files, the following procedure
can be followed. Note that all python files referenced can be found in the directory
``$GEOPM_SOURCE/integration/experiment/ffnet`` and are described fully in
``$GEOPM_SOURCE/integration/experiment/ffnet/README.md`` unless otherwise specified.
Note that this infrastructure relies on pytorch.

# Run ``neural_net_sweep.py`` on microbenchmarks of interest. 
  Some microbenchmarks that are supported in the integration infrastructure and have been 
  demonstrated to be useful include:

  * [CPU] Arithmetic Intensity Benchmark
  * [CPU] geopmbench
  * [GPU] parres dgemm
  * [GPU] parres stream

# Run ``gen_hdf_from_fsweep.py`` to generate HDF files from the frequency sweep reports
  and traces

# Run ``gen_neural_net.py`` to generate the neural net(s). CPU/GPU nets will be generated
  automatically based on the existence of required trace signals for each domain.

# Run ``gen_region_parameters.py`` to generate the region frequency recommendations.
  CPU recommendations will be generated in all cases. GPU recommendations will be 
  generated automatically based on the existence of the gpu-frequency field in the report.

# Before running the FFNet agent, the environment variables detailed above must be set
  to the paths of the neural net and frequency recommendation files.

Control Loop Rate
-----------------

The agent gates the control loop to sample hardware telemetry and 
control frequency at 20 millisecond intervals.
