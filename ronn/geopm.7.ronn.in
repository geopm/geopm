## INTEGRATION WITH PMPI
Linking to libgeopm will define symbols that intercept the MPI
interface through PMPI.  This can be disabled with the configure time
option `--disable-pmpi`, but is enabled by default.  See
`LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK` environment variable description below for the
runtime requirements of the PMPI design.  When using the GEOPM PMPI
interposition other profilers which use the same method will be in
conflict.  The GEOPM runtime can create an application performance
profile report and a trace of the application runtime.  As such, GEOPM
serves the role of an application profiler in addition to management
of power resources.  The report and trace generation are controlled by
the environment variables `GEOPM_REPORT` and `GEOPM_TRACE`; see
description below.

## INTEGRATION WITH OMPT
Unless the GEOPM runtime is configured to disable OpenMP, the library is compiled
against the OpenMP runtime.  If the OpenMP implementation
that GEOPM is compiled against supports the OMPT callbacks, then GEOPM will
use the OMPT callbacks to wrap OpenMP parallel regions with calls to
`geopm_prof_enter()` and `geopm_prof_exit()`.  In this way, any OpenMP parallel
region not within another application-defined region will be reported to the GEOPM
runtime.  This will appear in the report as a region name beginning with
"[OMPT]" and referencing the object file and function name containing
the OpenMP parallel region e.g.

`[OMPT]geopmbench:geopm::StreamModelRegion::run()`

To expressly enable this feature, pass the `--enable-ompt` configure
flag at GEOPM configure time.  This will build and install the LLVM OpenMP
runtime configured to support OMPT if the default OpenMP runtime does
not support the OMPT callbacks.  Note that your compiler must be
compatible with the LLVM OpenMP ABI for extending it in this way.

## LAUNCHING THE RUNTIME
The recommended method for launching the GEOPM runtime is the job
launch wrapper script **geopmlaunch(1)**.  See this man page for
details about the command line interface.  If your system does not support
`aprun` or `srun` for job launch, please make a change request for support
of the job launch method used on your system at the github issues page:

https://github.com/geopm/geopm/issues

Also, consider porting your job launch command into the
geopmpy.launcher module and submitting a change request as described
in CONTRIBUTING.md.

If the job launch application is not supported by the geopmpy.launcher
the recommended method is to use the environment variables described
in this man page including the `GEOPM_CTL` environment variable.
If using the "application" launch method then the **geopmctl(1)**
application should be launched in parallel.

There are legacy methods for launching the runtime programmatically.
These are documented in **geopm_ctl_c(3)**, but are deprecated as an
application-facing interface because their use within an application
is incompatible with the GEOPM launcher script.

## INTERPRETING THE REPORT
If the `GEOPM_REPORT` environment variable is set then a report will
be generated.  There is one report file generated for each run.  This
file has a header that describes the GEOPM version, job start time,
profile name (job description), and agent that were used during the run.
This is followed by a breakdown first by compute node host name and
then by each compute region.  The report file gives information about
runtime and energy use for each identified code region. Additionally,
time spent in calls to MPI is reported.  There may be Agent specific
report modifications see **geopm::Agent(3)** man page for more information.

It is important to note that per-region accounting in the report
includes only time spent in the region by all MPI ranks concurrently
on each compute node.  During the time when two ranks on a compute
node are not in the same marked region, the data collected is
attributed to the "unmarked" code region.  See the
`GEOPM_REGION_BARRIER` environment variable for more information about
debugging issues related region synchronicity.  In the future the
scope of this requirement may change from all ranks on a node to all
ranks running within the same domain of control.

## INTERPRETING THE TRACE
If the `GEOPM_TRACE` environment variable is set (see below) then a
trace file with time ordered information about the application runtime
is generated.  A separate trace file is generated for each compute
node and each file is a pipe (the `|` character) delimited ASCII
table. The file begins with a header that is marked by lines that
start with the `#` character.  The header contains information about
the GEOPM version, job start time, profile name (job description), and
agent that were used during the run.

The first row following the header gives a description of each field.
A simple method for selecting fields from the trace file is with the
`awk` command:

    $ grep -v '^#' geopm.trace-host0 | awk -F\| '{print $1, $2, $11}'

will print a subset of the fields in the trace file called
"geopm.trace-host0".

## ENVIRONMENT
When using the launcher wrapper script **geopmlaunch(1)**, the interface
to the GEOPM runtime is controlled exclusively by the launcher command line
options.  The launcher script sets the environment variables described in
this section according to the options specified on the command line.  Direct
use of these environment variables is only recommended when launching the GEOPM
runtime _without_ **geopmlaunch(1)**.

  * `LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK`:
    When dynamically linking an application to libgeopm for any
    features supported by the PMPI profiling of the MPI runtime it may
    be required that the LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK environment variable be set
    at runtime as is documented in the **ld.so(8)** man page.  When
    dynamically linking an application, if care is taken to link the
    libgeopm library before linking the library providing the weak MPI
    symbols, e.g. "-lgeopm -lmpi", linking order precedence will
    enforce the required override of the MPI interface symbols and the
    LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK environment variable is not required at runtime.

  * `GEOPM_REPORT`:
    If set then a report will be generated by the controller when it
    is destroyed.  The value of the variable determines the name of
    file generated.  The report contains a summary of performance and
    power aggregated over the program execution time and split out by
    host compute node and each code region.

  * `GEOPM_TRACE`:
    Enables GEOPM tracing capability.  Setting this variable enables
    the creation of a trace output file. The value of the variable is
    used as the base of the output trace file path.  One trace file is
    generated per compute node.  The file names of each trace are
    constructed by appending the node's hostname to base name given by
    the environment variable (separated by a '-').

  * `GEOPM_TRACE_SIGNALS`:
    Used to insert additional columns into the trace beyond the
    default columns and the columns added by the Agent.  The value
    must be formatted as a comma-separated list of valid signal names.
    All custom signals added to the trace will be sampled and
    aggregated for the entire node.  For example, the following will
    add total DRAM energy and power as columns in the trace:

    `GEOPM_TRACE_SIGNALS=ENERGY_DRAM,POWER_DRAM`

    The signals available and their descriptions are documented in the
    **PlatformIO(3)** man page.  "TIME", "REGION_ID#",
    "REGION_PROGRESS", "REGION_RUNTIME", "ENERGY_PACKAGE",
    "POWER_PACKAGE", and "FREQUENCY" are included in the trace by
    default.

  * `GEOPM_AGENT`:
    Used to select the Agent to be used by all Controllers.  The Agent
    will split policy information to be sent to controllers lower in
    the tree, and aggregate sampled data up the tree.  Available
    agents are: "monitor" (default if unset), "power_balancer",
    "power_governor", and "energy_efficient".

  * `GEOPM_POLICY`:
    Specifies a JSON file path containing the policy.  If the policy
    is provided through this file, it will only be read once and
    cannot be changed dynamically.  In this mode, samples will not be
    provided to the resource manager.  GEOPM_POLICY and GEOPM_ENDPOINT
    cannot be set simultaneously; refer to the documentation for
    GEOPM_ENDPOINT for more details.

  * `GEOPM_ENDPOINT`:
    Combined with GEOPM_SHMKEY, serves as the base name for policy and
    sample shared memory files used to communicate with the resource
    manager.  It should not contain the '/' character.  The location
    for policy values written by the resource manager and read by the
    Controller will be "/$(GEOPM_SHMKEY)-$(GEOPM_ENDPOINT).policy" and
    the location for sample values written by the Controller and read
    by the resource manager will be
    "/$(GEOPM_SHMKEY)-$(GEOPM_ENDPOINT).sample".  GEOPM_ENDPOINT and
    GEOPM_POLICY cannot be set simultaneously; the choice of
    which to set is determined by whether the Controller should use
    shared memory to receive policies dynamically from the resource
    manager, or use a JSON file to read a fixed policy.  One or the
    other must be set when launching the GEOPM controller through the
    PMPI interface (see GEOPM_CTL environment variable below).

  * `GEOPM_SHMKEY`:
    Override the default shared memory key base.  The shared memory
    key base prefixes all shared memory keys used by GEOPM to
    communicate between the compute application and the GEOPM runtime.
    The default key base is '/geopm-shm', this can be overridden by
    the environment variable.  A shared memory key must begin with the
    '/' character and have no other occurrence of the '/' character.
    The base key is extended for each shared memory region used by the
    runtime.  These keys should be cleaned up by the exception handler
    in case of an error or OS signal other than SIGKILL.  If the
    application is killed with SIGKILL or the keys are left behind for
    any other reason, a simple command to clean up after an aborted
    job is:

    `$ test -n "$GEOPM_SHMKEY" && rm -f /dev/shm${GEOPM_SHMKEY}* || rm -f /dev/shm/geopm-shm*`

  * `GEOPM_CTL`:
    When set to 'process' or 'pthread' this environment variable
    enables the launch of the GEOPM controller through the PMPI
    wrappers: in particular the wrappers for MPI_Init() or
    MPI_Init_thread().  In the case of specifying 'process' the
    controller will run as separate processes on a split off
    communicator comprised of the lowest rank on each node.
    Additionally through interception with the PMPI wrappers, the
    application MPI_COMM_WORLD appears to have one fewer rank per node
    than was allocated to the job.  In the case of specifying
    'pthread' the lowest rank on each node will launch a pthread
    running the controller.  The pthread launch mechanism requires an
    MPI runtime that can support MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE.  Support for
    this feature may require the LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK variable as
    documented above.

  * `GEOPM_PROFILE`:
    If set, will override the profile name to the value specified.
    The default profile name is the name of the compute application
    executable.  The profile name is printed in the report and trace(s) and
    can be used to index the report and trace data during  post-processing.
    When launching the GEOPM runtime with the geopmctl application, this
    variable must be set in the environment for the compute application
    and the geopmctl application.  The value of the variable must be the
    same in both contexts.

  * `GEOPM_PROFILE_TIMEOUT`:
    If set, will enable changing of the GEOPM profiler timeout.  The
    value is in seconds and represents the amount of time any application
    rank will wait for the controller before continuing execution. The
    default timeout is 30 seconds.

  * `GEOPM_PLUGIN_PATH`:
    The search path for GEOPM plugins. It is a colon-separated list of
    directories used by GEOPM to search for shared objects which
    contain GEOPM plugins.  In order to be available to the GEOPM
    runtime, plugins should register themselves with the appropriate
    factory.  See **geopm::PluginFactory(3)** for information about
    the GEOPM plugin interface.  The plugins are loaded

    A zero-length directory name indicates the current working
    directory.  A zero-length directory is inferred by a leading or
    trailing colon or two adjacent colons.  The default search
    location is always loaded first and is determined at library
    configuration time and by way of the 'pkglib' variable (typically
    /usr/lib64/geopm/).

  * `GEOPM_DEBUG_ATTACH`:
    Enables a serial debugger such as gdb to attach to a job when the
    GEOPM PMPI wrappers are enabled.  If set to a numerical value the
    associated rank will be trapped in MPI_Init() until a debugger is
    attached and the local variable "cont" is set to a non-zero value.
    If set, but not to a numerical value then all ranks are trapped.
    The runtime will print a message explaining the hostname and
    process ID that the debugger should attach to.

  * `GEOPM_REGION_BARRIER`:
    Enables a node local MPI_Barrier() at time of calling
    `geopm_region_enter`() or `geopm_region_exit`() for all
    application ranks that share a node.  Since the GEOPM controller
    only considers a region to be entered when all ranks on a node
    have entered the region, enabling this feature forces control
    throughout all of the time every rank spends in a region.  This
    feature is primarily used for debugging purposes.  WARNING: If all
    regions marked in the application are not entered synchronously by
    all ranks on a node then enabling this feature will cause a
    deadlock and the application will hang.

  * `GEOPM_COMM`:
    Used to select the plugin description string for communication.
    The comm plugin will be used for all communication between
    Controllers running on different nodes.  The only installed
    communication plugin uses MPI and the description string is
    "MPIComm".  The user may wish to implement other communication
    mechanisms.

  * `GEOPM_DISABLE_HYPERTHREADS`:
    Used by geopmlaunch job launch wrapper to disable the usage of
    hyperthreads for pinning purposes.  The default behavior is to use
    hyperthreads for pinning.  This environment variable serves the
    same purpose as the `--geopm-disable-hyperthreads` command line
    option.  If the environment variable is set and/or the command
    line option is specified then hyperthreads will be disabled.
