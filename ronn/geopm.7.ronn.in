## INTEGRATION WITH PMPI
Linking to libgeopm will define symbols that intercept the MPI
interface through PMPI.  This can be disabled with the configure time
option `--disable-pmpi`, but is enabled by default.  See
`LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK` environment variable description below for the
runtime requirements of the PMPI design.  When using the GEOPM PMPI
interposition other profilers which use the same method will be in
conflict.  The GEOPM runtime can create an application performance
profile report and a trace of the application runtime.  As such, GEOPM
serves the role of an application profiler in addition to management
of power resources.  The report and trace generation are controlled by
the environment variables `GEOPM_REPORT` and `GEOPM_TRACE`; see
description below.

## INTEGRATION WITH OMPT
Unless the GEOPM runtime is configured to disable OpenMP, the library
is compiled against the OpenMP runtime.  If the OpenMP implementation
that GEOPM is compiled against supports the OMPT callbacks, then GEOPM
will use the OMPT callbacks to wrap OpenMP parallel regions with calls
to `geopm_prof_enter()` and `geopm_prof_exit()`.  In this way, any
OpenMP parallel region not within another application-defined region
will be reported to the GEOPM runtime.  This will appear in the report
as a region name beginning with "[OMPT]" and referencing the object
file and function name containing the OpenMP parallel region e.g.

`[OMPT]geopmbench:geopm::StreamModelRegion::run()`

To expressly enable this feature, pass the `--enable-ompt` configure
flag at GEOPM configure time.  This will build and install the LLVM OpenMP
runtime configured to support OMPT if the default OpenMP runtime does
not support the OMPT callbacks.  Note that your compiler must be
compatible with the LLVM OpenMP ABI for extending it in this way.

## LAUNCHING THE RUNTIME
The recommended method for launching the GEOPM runtime is the job
launch wrapper script **geopmlaunch(1)**.  See this man page for
details about the command line interface.  If your system does not support
`aprun` or `srun` for job launch, please make a change request for support
of the job launch method used on your system at the github issues page:

https://github.com/geopm/geopm/issues

Also, consider porting your job launch command into the
geopmpy.launcher module and submitting a change request as described
in CONTRIBUTING.md.

If the job launch application is not supported by the geopmpy.launcher
the recommended method is to use the environment variables described
in this man page including the `GEOPM_CTL` environment variable.
If using the "application" launch method then the **geopmctl(1)**
application should be launched in parallel.

There are legacy methods for launching the runtime programmatically.
These are documented in **geopm_ctl_c(3)**, but are deprecated as an
application-facing interface because their use within an application
is incompatible with the GEOPM launcher script.

## INTERPRETING THE REPORT
If the `GEOPM_REPORT` environment variable is set then a report will
be generated.  There is one report file generated for each run.  This
file has a header that describes the GEOPM version, job start time,
profile name (job description), and agent that were used during the run.
This is followed by a breakdown first by compute node host name and
then by each compute region.  The report file gives information about
runtime and energy use for each identified code region. Additionally,
time spent in calls to MPI is reported.  There may be Agent specific
report modifications see **geopm::Agent(3)** man page for more information.

It is important to note that per-region accounting in the report
includes only time spent in the region by all MPI ranks concurrently
on each compute node.  During the time when two ranks on a compute
node are not in the same marked region, the data collected is
attributed to the "unmarked" code region.  See the
`GEOPM_REGION_BARRIER` environment variable for more information about
debugging issues related region synchronicity.  In the future the
scope of this requirement may change from all ranks on a node to all
ranks running within the same domain of control.

## INTERPRETING THE TRACE
If the `GEOPM_TRACE` environment variable is set (see below) then a
trace file with time ordered information about the application runtime
is generated.  A separate trace file is generated for each compute
node and each file is a pipe (the `|` character) delimited ASCII
table. The file begins with a header that is marked by lines that
start with the `#` character.  The header contains information about
the GEOPM version, job start time, profile name (job description), and
agent that were used during the run.

The first row following the header gives a description of each field.
A simple method for selecting fields from the trace file is with the
`awk` command:

    $ grep -v '^#' geopm.trace-host0 | awk -F\| '{print $1, $2, $11}'

will print a subset of the fields in the trace file called
"geopm.trace-host0".

## ENVIRONMENT
When using the launcher wrapper script **geopmlaunch(1)**, the interface
to the GEOPM runtime is controlled exclusively by the launcher command line
options.  The launcher script sets the environment variables described in
this section according to the options specified on the command line.  Direct
use of these environment variables is only recommended when launching the GEOPM
runtime _without_ **geopmlaunch(1)**.

  * `LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK`:
    When dynamically linking an application to libgeopm for any
    features supported by the PMPI profiling of the MPI runtime it may
    be required that the LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK environment variable be set
    at runtime as is documented in the **ld.so(8)** man page.  When
    dynamically linking an application, if care is taken to link the
    libgeopm library before linking the library providing the weak MPI
    symbols, e.g. "-lgeopm -lmpi", linking order precedence will
    enforce the required override of the MPI interface symbols and the
    LD_DYNAMIC_WEAK environment variable is not required at runtime.
