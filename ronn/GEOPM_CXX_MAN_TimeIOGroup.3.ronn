## DESCRIPTION

This IOGroup provides an implementation of the TIME signal for the
time since GEOPM startup.

## CLASS METHODS

  * `signal_names`():
    Returns the time signal name, "TIME::ELAPSED", and its alias, "TIME".

  * `control_names`():
    Does nothing; this IOGroup does not provide any controls.

  * `is_valid_signal`():
    Returns true if the _signal_name is one from the list returned by
    signal_names().

  * `is_valid_control`():
    Returns false; this IOGroup does not provide any controls.

  * `signal_domain_type`():
    If the _signal_name_ is valid for this IOGroup, returns
    M_DOMAIN_BOARD.

  * `control_domain_type`():
    Returns M_DOMAIN_INVALID; this IOGroup does not provide any controls.

  * `push_signal`():
    Since this IOGroup only provides one signal, returns 0 if the _signal_name_
    is valid.  The _domain_type_ and _domain_idx_ are ignored.

  * `push_control`():
    Should not be called; this IOGroup does not provide any controls.

  * `read_batch`():
    If a time signal has been pushed, updates the time since the
    TimeIOGroup was created.

  * `write_batch`():
    Does nothing; this IOGroup does not provide any controls.

  * `sample`():
    Returns the value of the signal specified by a _signal_idx_
    returned from push_signal().  The value will have been updated by
    the most recent call to read_batch().

  * `adjust`():
    Should not be called; this IOGroup does not provide any controls.

  * `read_signal`():
    If _signal_name_ is valid, immediately return the time since the
    TimeIOGroup was created.

  * `write_control`():
    Should not be called; this IOGroup does not provide any controls.

  * `save_control`():
    Does nothing; this IOGroup does not provide any controls.

  * `restore_control`():
    Does nothing; this IOGroup does not provide any controls.

  * `agg_function`():
    The TIME signal provided by this IOGroup is aggregated using the
    average() function from **geopm::Agg(3)**.

  * `signal_description`():
    Returns a string description for _signal_name_, if defined.

  * `control_description`():
    Does nothing; this IOGroup does not provide any controls.

  * `signal_behavior`():
    Returns one of the IOGroup::signal_behavior_e values which
    describes about how a signal will change as a function of time.
    This can be used when generating reports to decide how to
    summarize a signal's value for the entire application run.

  * `plugin_name`():
    Returns the name of the plugin to use when this plugin is
    registered with the IOGroup factory; see
    **geopm::PluginFactory(3)** for more details.

  * `make_plugin`():
    Returns a pointer to a new TimeIOGroup object; see
    **geopm::PluginFactory(3)** for more details.
