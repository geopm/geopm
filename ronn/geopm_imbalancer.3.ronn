## SYNOPSIS
**\#include [<geopm_imbalancer.h>](https://github.com/geopm/geopm/blob/dev/src/geopm_imbalancer.h)**

`Link with -lgeopm (MPI) or -lgeopmpolicy (non-MPI)`

  * `int geopm_imbalancer_frac(`:
    `double` _frac_`);`

  * `int geopm_imbalancer_enter(`:
    `void);`

  * `int geopm_imbalancer_exit(`:
    `void);`

## DESCRIPTION
The _geopm_imbalancer.h_ header defines interfaces for accessing the
imbalancer singleton, which is an object used to add artificial
imbalance to regions as a fraction of the total region runtime.  In
particular, it is used by the ModelRegion of the geopmbench
application to simulate imbalance between nodes.  If the environment
variable IMBALANCER_CONFIG is set to a file path, the file will be
searched for the hostname of the current node and the imbalance
fraction will be set to the given value.  This file should be
formatted with a hostname and double fraction on each line, separated
by a space.

  * `geopm_imbalancer_frac`():
    Used to set a delay _frac_ that will sleep for the given fraction
    of the region runtime.

  * `geopm_imbalancer_enter`():
    Sets the entry time for the imbalanced region.

  * `geopm_imbalancer_exit`():
    Spins until the region has been extended by the previously specified delay.
