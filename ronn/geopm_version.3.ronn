## SYNOPSIS
**\#include [<geopm.h>](https://github.com/geopm/geopm/blob/dev/src/geopm.h)**

`Link with -lgeopm (MPI) or -lgeopmpolicy (non-MPI)`

`const char *geopm_version(void);`

## DESCRIPTION
    Returns a human readable string describing the version of the GEOPM library
    linked to the calling application.  The form is <MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<HOTFIX> for
    released versions and <MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<HOTFIX>+dev<COUNT>g<HASH> for
    development snapshots.  MAJOR is the major revision number, MINOR is the minor
    revision number, HOTFIX is the hotfix iteration, COUNT is the number of git
    commits since the tagged release and HASH is the git SHA-1 hash of the last
    commit.  For example "0.0.1" is a release version, "0.0.1+dev21g986987f" is a
    development snapshot 21 commits away from the 0.0.1 release with the git SHA-1
    that begins with "986987f".
