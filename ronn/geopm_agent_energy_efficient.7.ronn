## DESCRIPTION

The goal of this Agent is to save energy without degrading performance
beyond an acceptable limit.  It achieves this by setting frequencies
per region so that memory- and I/O-bound regions run at lower
frequencies without increasing runtime but CPU-bound regions are still
run at high frequencies.

There are two modes available: offline and online.  In the offline
mode, the best frequencies for each region are specified in the
environment variable `GEOPM_EFFICIENT_FREQ_RID_MAP`, which is a
JSON-formatted string mapping region name to frequency in Hertz,
e.g. '{"region1": 1200000000, "region2": 1500000000}'.  If a frequency
for a region is not specified, the region hint will be used and the
frequency will be set to either the minimum or maximum available
frequency.  See **geopm_prof_c(3)** for the list of region hints.
These best-fit frequencies can be determined by running the
application once at each available frequency and checking the
performance of each region; this frequency sweep is available as an
analysis type for `geopmanalysis` described in **geopmanalysis(1)**.
The online mode finds the optimal frequency for each region
dynamically by measuring the performance of each region and reducing
the frequency as long as the performance is still within acceptable
limits.  The performance metric used is the maximum of the runtimes
reported by each rank for the last execution of the region in question
(lower is better).  It also avoids reducing frequency if energy would
increase (due to performance loss in a frequency-sensitive region). Up
to 10% performance loss is allowed.  Enable the online mode by setting
`GEOPM_EFFICIENT_FREQ_ONLINE` and unsetting
`GEOPM_EFFICIENT_FREQ_RID_MAP`.

## AGENT BEHAVIOR HIGHLIGHTS

* `Agent Name`:
  Set the `GEOPM_AGENT` environment variable to "energy_efficient" and
  the Controller will select the EnergyEfficientAgent for its control
  handler.  See **geopm(7)** for more information about environment
  variables.

* `Ordered Policies Descending`:
  The minimum and maximum frequency are passed down as policies.
  Setting both to the same value can be used to force the entire
  application to run at one frequency.

  `FREQ_MIN`: The minimum frequency that the algorithm is allowed to
              choose for any region.  If NAN is passed, it will use
              the minimum available frequency by default.

  `FREQ_MAX`: The maximum frequency that the algorithm is allowed to
              choose for any region.  If NAN is passed, it will use
              the maximum available frequency by default.

* `Ordered Samples Ascending`:

  `ENERGY_PACKAGE`: Total energy from the packages across all nodes.

  `ENERGY_DRAM`: Total energy from DRAM across all nodes.

  `FREQUENCY`: The average frequency across nodes.

* `Tracing Modifications`:
  N/A

* `Report Modifiers`:
  The per-node final frequency for each region is added to the report.
  This reflects the settings from the map or hint in offline mode, or
  the learned best frequency determined by the online mode.

* `Control Loop Gate`:
  The agent gates the Controller's control loop to a cadence of 5ms.
  This agent propagates its ascending signals up the tree every 50ms
  (10 control cycles).
