## DESCRIPTION

The goal of this Agent is to save energy without degrading performance
beyond an acceptable limit.  It achieves this by setting frequencies
per region so that memory- and I/O-bound regions run at lower
frequencies without increasing runtime but CPU-bound regions are still
run at high frequencies.

There are two modes available: offline and online.  In the offline
mode, the best frequencies for each region are specified in the
environment variable `GEOPM_EFFICIENT_FREQ_RID_MAP`.  If a frequency
for a region is not specified, the region hint will be used to pick
the minimum or maximum frequency.  These best-fit frequencies can be
determined by running the application once at each available frequency
and checking the performance of each region; this frequency sweep is
available as an analysis type for `geopmanalysis` described in
**geopmanalysis(1)**.  The online mode finds the optimal frequency for
each region dynamically by measuring the performance of each region
and reducing the frequency as long as the performance is still within
acceptable limits. Up to 10% performance loss is allowed.  Enable the
online mode by setting `GEOPM_EFFICIENT_FREQ_ONLINE` and unsetting
`GEOPM_EFFICIENT_FREQ_RID_MAP`.

## AGENT BEHAVIOR HIGHLIGHTS

* Agent Name:
  Set the `GEOPM_AGENT` environment varible to "energy_efficient" and
  the Kontroller will select the EnergyEfficientAgent for its
  control handler.

* Samples Ascending:
  The average frequency across nodes is passed up as a sample.

* Policies Descending:
  The minimum and maximum frequency are passed down as policies.
  Setting both to the same value can be used to force the entire
  application to run at one frequency.

* Tracing Modifications:
  N/A

* Report Modifiers:
  The per-node final frequency for each region is added to the report.

* Control Loop Gate:
  The agent gates the Kontroller's control loop to a cadence of 5ms.
  This agent propagates its ascending signals up the tree every 50ms
  (10 control cycles).
