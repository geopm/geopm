## SYNOPSIS

**\#include [<geopm_error.h>](https://github.com/geopm/geopm/blob/dev/src/geopm_error.h)**

`Link with -lgeopm (MPI) or -lgeopmpolicy (non-MPI)`

  * `void geopm_error_message(`:
    `int` _err_, <br>
    `char *`_msg_, <br>
    `size_t` _size_`);`

## DESCRIPTION
All **geopm(7)** C and Fortran APIs that can have an error condition
occur during runtime return an error number.  This is the way
**geopm(7)** handles errors, and almost all of the interfaces behave
this way.  This man page describes how to interpret these returned
error codes.  A returned error number of zero by a GEOPM API indicates
success.  If the error number returned by a GEOPM API is positive then
this indicates a generic system error, and if the error number is
negative this indicates a **geopm(7)** specific error has occurred.
The GEOPM specific error numbers are enumerated in the _geopm_error.h_
header file and they are described below.  The system error numbers
are documented in the **errno(3)** man page.

Any non-zero error number can be passed as the _err_ parameter to the
**geopm_error_message()** function and it will be converted into a
descriptive string _msg_.  The string _msg_ is user allocated buffer
of length _size_ bytes.  The result, _msg_ will always be NULL
terminated even if the message is truncated to fit in the _msg_
buffer.

When a geopm C interface returns a non-zero value and this value is
subsequently passed as the _err_ argument to
**geopm_error_message()**, the message may contain detailed
information about the failure that most recently occurred.  The
details may include the source file, line number, and a detailed
description of the error condition.  If possible, please provide this
message when reporting a bug to the GEOPM developers.
