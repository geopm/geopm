## DESCRIPTION

The PowerGovernorAgent enforces a per-compute-node power cap of the
total power of all packages (sockets).

## AGENT BEHAVIOR HIGHLIGHTS
Policies and samples are vectors of double precision values where each
value has a meaning defined by the **geopm::Agent(3)** implementation.
The Agent interface also provides methods for the Agent to extend
reports and traces with additional Agent-specific information.

* `Agent Name`:
  Set the `--geopm-agent` launch option or `GEOPM_AGENT` environment
  variable to "power_governor" and the Controller will select the
  PowerGovernorAgent for its control handler.  See **geopmlaunch(1)**
  and **geopm(7)** for more information about launch options and
  environment variables.

* `Agent Policy Definitions`:

  `POWER_PACKAGE_LIMIT_TOTAL`: Sets the average power cap per compute
                               node in units of watts.  If NAN is
                               passed for the power cap, the value
                               will default to the thermal design
                               power (TDP).  Each package on the node
                               will be given an equal fraction of the
                               total power.

* `Agent Sample Definitions`:

  `POWER`: Median total package and DRAM power for the node in watts
           measured over the last epoch.

  `IS_CONVERGED`: Will be 1.0 if the power policy has been
                  enforced and the power consumption by all nodes is
                  within the assigned limits, otherwise it will be
                  0.0.

  `POWER_AVERAGE_ENFORCED`: Enforced power limit averaged over all
                            compute nodes.  This value corresponds to
                            the `POWER_PACKAGE_LIMIT_TOTAL` policy
                            field and is expected to match unless the
                            policy is unachievable.

* `Trace Column Extensions`:

  `power_budget`: Power budget assigned to the compute node associated
                  with the trace file at time of sampling.


* `Report Extensions`:
  N/A

* `Control Loop Gate`:
  The agent gates the Controller's control loop to a cadence
  of 5ms.
