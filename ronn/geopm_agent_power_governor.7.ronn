## DESCRIPTION

The PowerGovernorAgent is designed to enforce a per-compute-node power
cap by varying the package power limit in response to the measured
DRAM power.

## AGENT BEHAVIOR HIGHLIGHTS

* `Agent Name`:
  Set the `GEOPM_AGENT` environment variable to "power_governor" and
  the Kontroller instances will select the PowerGovernorAgent for
  its control handler.  See **geopm(7)** for more information about
  environment variables.

* `Ordered Policies Descending`:

  `POWER`: Sets the average power cap per compute node in
                   units of Watts.

* `Ordered Samples Ascending`:

  `POWER_MAXIMUM`: Maximum power excursion in Watts measured over the
                   last epoch.  The maximum power excursion is
                   determined by differencing energy values across the
                   time window provided by the policy.

  `IS_CONVERGED`: Will be 1.0 if the power policy has been
                  enforced and the power consumption by all nodes is
                  within the assigned limits, otherwise it will be
                  0.0.

* `Tracing Modifications`:

  `power_package`: Instantaneous power measurement of all processor
                   packages on each compute node averaged over all
                   compute nodes allocated to the application.

  `power_dram`: Instantaneous power measurement of all DRAM modules in
                each compute node averaged over all compute nodes
                allocated to the application.

  `power_budget`: Power budget assigned to the compute node associated
                  with the trace file at time of sampling.


* `Report Modifiers`:
  N/A

* `Control Loop Gate`:
  The agent gates the Kontroller's control loop to a cadence of 5
  updates to the POWER_PACKAGE platform signal.  This agent propagates
  its ascending signals up the tree every 50 updates to the
  POWER_PACKAGE platform signal (i.e. 10 control cycles).  For
  example, on KNL this is around 5ms.
