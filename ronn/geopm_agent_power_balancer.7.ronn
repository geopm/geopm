## DESCRIPTION

The PowerBalancerAgent is designed to enforce an application wide
average per-compute-node power cap while varying the power cap of
individual compute nodes to optimize overall application performance.
This is achieved by providing more than average power to the compute
nodes reporting lower performance and less than average power to the
nodes with higher performance.  The algorithm is designed to mitigate
load imbalance in the application through the redistribution of power.

The relationship between power cap and application performance is
dependent on many factors including the instruction mix of the
application, manufacturing variation between the processors, problem
size, and data locality.  Because these factors and their
relationships are not easily measured or predicted, determining the
correct power budget to achieve balanced performance is determined
empirically through trials.

The application performance is measured by the duration of application
epoch.  The epoch run time is reported by each MPI rank once every
trip around the outer loop of an iterative application, if the
application has been annotated with a call to geopm_prof_epoch().  See
the **geopm_prof_c(3)** man page for more information about geopm
profiling methods.  Note that the epoch runtime used by the
PowerBalancerAgent excludes any time spent in MPI communication
routines.  A windowed median filter is applied to the sequence of
epoch times recorded by each rank, and then the maximum of these
median filtered values across all MPI ranks running on each compute
node is used as the measure of the inverse of compute node
performance.

## AGENT BEHAVIOR HIGHLIGHTS

* `Agent Name`:
  Set the `GEOPM_AGENT` environment variable or `--geopm-agent` option
  to "power_balancer" and the Controller will select the
  PowerBalancerAgent for its control handler.  See **geopm(7)** for
  more information about environment variables.

* `Ordered Policies Descending`:

  `POWER_CAP`: Sets the average power cap per compute node in units of
               Watts.  The power cap applied to any one compute node
               may be higher or lower than this parameter, but the
               average power cap in aggregate across all compute nodes
               controlled by the policy will be equal to this value.
               If NAN is passed for the power cap, the value will
               default to the thermal design power (TDP).

  `STEP_COUNT`: Used as an inter-agent message passed through the
                policy.  This parameter is not used if the `POWER_CAP`
                policy is non-zero.  When creating a static policy
                file or when setting a policy with the
                geopm_endpoint_agent_policy() API the `POWER_CAP`
                should be non-zero, and this value can be set to zero.
                If set to NAN, it will default to 0.

  `MAX_EPOCH_RUNTIME`: Used as an inter-agent message passed through
                       the policy.  This parameter is not used if the
                       `POWER_CAP` policy is non-zero.  When creating
                       a static policy file or when setting a policy
                       with the geopm_endpoint_agent_policy() API the
                       `POWER_CAP` should be non-zero, and this value
                       can be set to zero.  If set to NAN, it will
                       default to 0.

  `POWER_SLACK`: Used as an inter-agent message passed through the
                 policy.  This parameter is not used if the
                 `POWER_CAP` policy is non-zero.  When creating a
                 static policy file or when setting a policy with the
                 geopm_endpoint_agent_policy() API the `POWER_CAP`
                 should be non-zero, and this value can be set to
                 zero.  If set to NAN, it will default to 0.

* `Ordered Samples Ascending`:

   `STEP_COUNT`: Number of iterations of the optimization algorithm
                 since the start of the application or the last update
                 to the average power cap received through the
                 endpoint.  Note that the algorithm is comprised of
                 three types of steps which are repeated, and the type
                 of step can be inferred by the `STEP_COUNT` modulo
                 three: 0 implies sending down a power cap or slack
                 power, 1 implies measuring the runtime under the
                 latest distribution of power, and 2 implies that the
                 power limit is being reduced until the slowest
                 runtime is met and slack power is sent up the tree.

   `MAX_EPOCH_RUNTIME`: Maximum runtime measured after applying
                        uniform power cap, or after the last
                        redistribution of slack power.

   `SUM_POWER_SLACK`: Sum of all slack power available after reducing
                      the power limits to achieve the maximum runtime
                      reported by any node under the current
                      distribution of power limits over compute nodes.

* `Tracing Modifications`:

  `epoch_runtime`: Time interval in seconds between the last two epoch
                   calls by the application averaged over all ranks on
                   the node and excluding time spent in MPI calls.

  `power_limit`: Power limit assigned to the compute node associated
                 with the trace file at time of sampling.


* `Report Modifiers`:
  N/A

* `Control Loop Gate`:
  The agent gates the Controller's control loop to a cadence of 5
  milliseconds.
