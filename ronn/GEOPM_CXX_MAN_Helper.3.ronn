## SYNOPSIS

**\#include [<geopm/Helper.hpp>](https://github.com/geopm/geopm/blob/dev/src/Helper.hpp)**

`Link with -lgeopm (MPI) or -lgeopmpolicy (non-MPI)`

  * `template <class Type, class ...Args> std::unique_ptr<Type> make_unique(`:
    `Args &`_&...args_`);`

  * `std::string read_file(`:
    `const std::string& `_path_`);`

  * `std::vector<std::string> split_string(`:
    `const std::string &`_str_`,`<br>
    `const std::string &`_delim_`);`

## DESCRIPTION
The _Helper.hpp_ file defines various utility functions.

  * `make_unique`():
    Implementation of std::make_unique (C++14) for C++11, scoped to
    the geopm:: namespace.  Note that this version will only work for
    non-array types.

  * `read_file`():
    Reads the file specified by _path_ and returns the contents in a string.

  * `split_string`():
    Splits a string _str_ according to a delimiter _delim_ and returns
    the pieces in a vector.  The delimiter cannot be empty.
