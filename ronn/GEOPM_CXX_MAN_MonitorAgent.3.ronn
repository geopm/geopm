## SYNOPSIS

**\#include [<geopm/MonitorAgent.hpp>](https://github.com/geopm/geopm/blob/dev/src/MonitorAgent.hpp)**

`Link with -lgeopm (MPI) or -lgeopmpolicy (non-MPI)`

This class implements all public methods of the **geopm::Agent(3)** interface.

  * `static std::string plugin_name(`:
    `void);`

  * `static std::unique_ptr<Agent> make_plugin(`:
    `void);`

  * `static std::vector<std::string> policy_names(`:
    `void);`

  * `static std::vector<std::string> sample_names(`:
    `void);`

## DESCRIPTION
The MonitorAgent is used to do sampling only; no policy will be
enforced.  The behavior of this agent is described in more detail in
the **geopm_agent_monitor(7)** man page.

## CLASS METHODS

  * `init`():


  * `validate_policy`():


  * `descend`():


  * `ascend`():


  * `adjust_platform`():


  * `sample_platform`():


  * `wait`():
    Waits until the time since the last wait call reaches 5ms.  This
    causes the Controller main loop to happen with a 5ms cadence.

  * `report_header`():


  * `report_node`():


  * `report_region`():


  * `trace_names`():


  * `trace_values`():


  * `plugin_name`():


  * `make_plugin`():


  * `policy_names`():


  * `sample_names`():

  * `plugin_name`():
    Returns the name of the plugin to use when registering this plugin
    with the factory.

  * `make_plugin`():
    Returns a pointer to a new MonitorAgent object.

  * `policy_names`():
    Returns an empty vector; no policies are expected by this Agent.

  * `sample_names`():
    Returns the names of the samples returned by ascend().
