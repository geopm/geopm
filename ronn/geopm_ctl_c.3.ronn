## SYNOPSIS

`Link with -lgeopm`

  * `int geopm_ctl_create(`:
    `MPI_Comm` _comm_, <br>
    `struct geopm_ctl_c **`_ctl_`);`

  * `int geopm_ctl_destroy(`:
    `struct geopm_ctl_c *`_ctl_`);`

  * `int geopm_ctl_run(`:

    `pthread_t *`_thread_`);`


## DESCRIPTION
The geopm_ctl_c structure is used to launch the global extensible open
power manager algorithm.  There are several ways to enable control:
running the control algorithm as a distinct processes from the
application under control, or running the control algorithm as a
separate pthread owned by the application process under control.  Each
of these methods has different requirements and trade offs.

  * `geopm_ctl_create`():
    creates a geopm_ctl_c object, _ctl_ which is an opaque structure
    that holds the state used to execute the control algorithm with
    one of the other functions described in this man page.  The
    control algorithm relies on feedback about the application
    profile.  The user provides an MPI communicator, _comm_ which must
    have at least one process running on every compute node under
    control.

  * `geopm_ctl_destroy`():
    destroys all resources associated with the _ctl_ structure which
    allocated by a previous call to `geopm_ctl_create`().

  * `geopm_ctl_run`():
    steps the control algorithm continuously until the application
    signals shutdown.

  * `geopm_ctl_pthread`():
    creates a POSIX thread running the control algorithm continuously
    until the application signals shutdown.  With this method of launch
    the supporting MPI implementation must be enabled for
    `MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE` using `MPI_Init_thread`().

## ERRORS
All functions described on this man page return an error code.  See
**geopm_error(3)** for a full description of the error numbers and how
to convert them to strings.
