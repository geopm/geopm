## SYNOPSIS

`geopmlaunch` launcher [_LAUNCHER_OPTIONS_] [_OPTIONS_] `--` executable [_exec-args_]


## DESCRIPTION
The GEOPM launcher enables users to launch the GEOPM runtime with a
simple command line interface extension to the resource manager's
underlying job launch mechanism deployed on their system.  The
currently supported job launch mechanisms are `srun` from the SLURM
package and `aprun` from the ALPS package.  The GEOPM package installs
the `geopmlaunch` executable which runs the
geopmpy.launcher.main() method in the geopmpy python package.  This
interface extends the resource manager's job launch application with
GEOPM-specific flags.  All application launch options accepted by the
underlying launch application (e.g. `srun` or `aprun`) can be passed
to the `geopmlaunch` wrapper with the exception of CPU affinity related
options.  The wrapper script reinterprets the command line to set
environment variables and pass modified options to the underlying job
launch application.  The reinterpreted command line is echoed to
standard output by the script before execution.  The wrapper sets
environment variables used by GEOPM which are described in
**geopm(7)**, sets process CPU affinity to meet the requirements of
GEOPM, and may increase the ranks per node or CPUs per process as
required by the GEOPM runtime.

Note: the primary compute executable and its command line options must
appear at the end of the command line and be preceded by two dashes:
`--`. The GEOPM launcher will stop parsing arguments following the `--`
sequence and pass the arguments that follow unaltered while removing
the first `--` from the command line.

## SUPPORTED LAUNCHERS
  The first positional argument is required and specifies the desired
  underlying launch mechanism.  Valid values are "srun", "aprun", or "impi".
  Additionally the launcher class that supports the resource manager can be
  selected by name; available launcher classes are "SrunLauncher"
  (SLURM), "AlpsLauncher" (ALPS), "IMPIExecLauncher" (IMPI), or
  "SrunTOSSLauncher" (specialization of SLURM for the tri-lab
  operating system stack).  This command line option overrides other
  methods of determining the resource manager / launcher.  This option is
  used by the launcher to set the GEOPM_RM environment variable.  The
  command line argument will override any value currently set in the environment.
  See the ENVIRONMENT section of **geopm(7)**.

## OPTIONS
* `--geopm-ctl` _process_|_pthread_|_application_:
  Use GEOPM runtime and launch GEOPM with one of three methods:
  _process_, _pthread_ or _application_.  The _process_ method
  allocates one extra MPI process per node for the GEOPM controller.
  The _pthread_ method spawns a thread from one MPI process per node
  to run the GEOPM controller.  The _application_ method launches the
  **geopmctl(1)** application in the background which connects to the
  primary compute application.  The _process_ method can be used in
  the widest variety of cases, but some systems require that each MPI
  process be assigned the same number of CPUs which may waste
  resources by assigning more than one CPU to the GEOPM controller
  process.  The _pthread_ option requires support for
  MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE which is not enabled at many sites and on some
  systems affinitizing one extra CPU to the MPI process that threads
  out the controller may be not be possible resulting in running the
  GEOPM controller on the same CPU as the main compute application.
  The _application_ method of launch is not compatible with `aprun`;
  with `srun`, the call must be made inside of an existing
  allocation made with salloc or sbatch and the command must request
  all of the compute nodes assigned to the allocation.  Note: if the
  `--geopm-ctl` option is not specified the launcher script simply
  passes all command line arguments to the system application launcher
  without modification.  This option is used by the launcher to set
  the GEOPM_CTL environment variable.  The command line option
  will override any value currently set in the environment.  See the
  ENVIRONMENT section of **geopm(7)**.

* `--geopm-policy` policy:
  GEOPM policy JSON file used to configure the Agent plugin.  To
  provide a shared memory region name, `--geopm-endpoint` should be
  used instead.  See **geopmagent(1)** and **geopm_agent_c(3)** for
  more information about how to create this input file.  This option
  is used by the launcher to set the GEOPM_POLICY environment
  variable.  The command line option will override any value currently
  set in the environment.  See the ENVIRONMENT section of
  **geopm(7)**.

* `--geopm-endpoint` endpoint:

  Basename for the policy and sample shared memory regions used to
  communicate with the resource manager.  This allows the resource
  manager to dynamically control GEOPM plugins and collect feedback at
  runtime.  See **geopmendpoint(1)** and **geopm_endpoint_c(3)** to
  learn about creating the shared memory region.  This option is used
  by the launcher to set the GEOPM_ENDPOINT environment variable.  The
  command line option will override any value currently set in the
  environment.  See the ENVIRONMENT section of **geopm(7)**.

* `--geopm-shmkey` key:
  Specify a special prefix to be used with all of the shared memory
  keys generated by the GEOPM runtime.  This is useful for avoiding
  collisions with keys that were not properly cleaned up.  The default
  key prefix is "geopm-shm".  This option is used by the launcher to
  set the GEOPM_SHMKEY environment variable.  The command line option
  will override any value currently set in the environment.  See the
  ENVIRONMENT section of **geopm(7)**.

* `--geopm-timeout` sec:
  Time in seconds that the application should wait for the GEOPM
  controller to connect over shared memory.  The default value is 30
  seconds.  This option is used by the launcher to set the
  GEOPM_PROFILE_TIMEOUT environment variable.  The command line option
  will override any value currently set in the environment.  See the
  ENVIRONMENT section of **geopm(7)**.

* `--geopm-report` path:
  Path to the GEOPM report output file describing the profiling
  information collected by GEOPM.  This file is generated at the
  conclusion of the run if this option is given and will be written to
  the file system path specified or current directory if only a file
  name is given.  The report is a single file contains information
  about runtimes, MPI usage, and power consumption for each node.  The
  report is broken down by region if the application has been
  annotated with the GEOPM region interface.  Note that the sampled
  values for 'energy' and 'sync-runtime' are added to the total for a
  region only when all ranks are in a region; otherwise they are added
  to the unmarked region.  The epoch region and application total
  energy are not calculated by sampling but rather through start and
  end values.  When comparing energy and time values from the report,
  care should be taken to use 'runtime' in the case of epoch and
  application totals, and 'sync-runtime' for all other regions.  This
  option is used by the launcher to set the GEOPM_REPORT environment
  variable.  The command line option will override any value currently
  set in the environment.  See the ENVIRONMENT section of
  **geopm(7)**.

* `--geopm-trace` path:
  The base name and path of the trace file(s) generated if this option
  is specified.  One trace file is generated for each compute node
  used by the application containing a pipe-delimited ASCII table
  describing a time series of measurements made by the GEOPM runtime.
  The path is extended with the host name of the node for each created
  file.  The trace files will be written to the file system path
  specified or current directory if only a file name is given.  This
  feature is primarily a debugging tool, and may not scale to large
  node counts due to file system issues.  This option is used by the
  launcher to set the GEOPM_TRACE environment variable.  The command
  line option will override any value currently set in the
  environment.  See the ENVIRONMENT section of **geopm(7)**.

* `--geopm-trace-signals` signals:
  A comma-separated list of signal names to be added as columns in the
  trace.  This option has no effect unless tracing is enabled with
  `--geopm-trace`.  The signal names must be valid for the platform
  and will be sampled for the entire node.  Refer to the documentation
  for GEOPM_TRACE_SIGNALS in **geopm(7)** for a list of valid signal
  names. For example, the following will add total DRAM energy and
  power as columns in the trace:

  `GEOPM_TRACE_SIGNALS=ENERGY_DRAM,POWER_DRAM`

* `--geopm-agent` agent:
  Specify the Agent to be used by all Controllers.  Available agents
  are: "monitor" (default if option not specified), "power_balancer",
  "power_governor", and "energy_efficient".  See
  **geopm_agent_monitor(7)**, **geopm_agent_power_balancer(7)**,
  **geopm_agent_power_governor(7)**, and **geopm_agent_energy_efficient(7)**
  for descriptions of each agent.  This option is used by the launcher
  to set the GEOPM_AGENT environment variable.  The command line option
  will override any value currently set in the environment.  See the
  ENVIRONMENT section of **geopm(7)**.

* `--geopm-profile` name:
  The name of the profile which is printed in the report and trace
  files.  This name can be used to index the data in post-processing.
  For example, when running a sweep of experiments with multiple power
  caps, the profile could contain the power setting for one run.
  This option is used by the launcher to set the GEOPM_PROFILE
  environment variable.  The command line option will override any
  value currently set in the environment.  See the ENVIRONMENT section
  of **geopm(7)**.

* `--geopm-plugin-path` path:
  Enables GEOPM to search for plugins in places other than the default
  location.  The option is a ":" separated list of directories to
  search.  This option is used by the launcher to set the GEOPM_PLUGIN_PATH
  environment variable.  The command line option will override any
  value currently set in the environment.  See the ENVIRONMENT section
  of **geopm(7)**.

* `--geopm-debug-attach` rank:
  Enables a serial debugger such as gdb to attach to a job when the
  GEOPM PMPI wrappers are enabled.  If set to a numerical value the
  associated rank will be trapped in MPI_Init() until a debugger is
  attached and the local variable "cont" is set to a non-zero value.
  If set, but not to a numerical value then all ranks are trapped.
  The runtime will print a message explaining the hostname and process
  ID that the debugger should attach to.  This option is used by the
  launcher to set the GEOPM_DEBUG_ATTACH environment variable.  The
  command line option will override any value currently set in the
  environment.  See the ENVIRONMENT section of **geopm(7)**.

* `--geopm-region-barrier`:
  Enables a node local MPI_Barrier() at time of calling
  `geopm_region_enter`() or `geopm_region_exit`() for all application
  ranks that share a node.  Since the GEOPM controller only considers
  a region to be entered when all ranks on a node have entered the
  region, enabling this feature forces control throughout all of the
  time every rank spends in a region.  This feature is primarily used
  for debugging purposes.  WARNING: If all regions marked in the
  application are not entered synchronously by all ranks on a node
  then enabling this feature will cause a deadlock and the application
  will hang.  This option is used by the launcher to set the
  GEOPM_REGION_BARRIER environment variable.  The command line option
  will override any value currently set in the environment.  See the
  ENVIRONMENT section of **geopm(7)**.

* `--geopm-preload`:
  Use LD_PRELOAD to link libgeopm.so at runtime.  This can be used to
  enable the GEOPM runtime when an application has not been compiled
  against libgeopm.so.

* `--geopm-disable-hyperthreads`:
  Prevent the launcher from trying to use hyperthreads for pinning
  purposes when attempting to satisfy the MPI ranks / OMP threads
  configuration specified.  This is done for both the controller and
  the application.  An error is raised if the launcher cannot satisfy
  the current request without hyperthreads.

## EXAMPLES
Use geopmlaunch to queue a job using geopmbench on a SLURM managed system
requesting two nodes using 32 application MPI process each with four threads:

    geopmlaunch srun -N 2 -n 32 -c 4 --geopm-ctl=process \
                                     --geopm-report=tutorial6.report \
                                     -- ./geopmbench tutorial6_config.json

Use geopmlaunch to launch the miniFE executable with the same configuration,
but on an ALPS managed system:

    geopmlaunch aprun -N 2 -n 64 --cpus-per-pe 4 \
                                 --geopm-ctl process \
                                 --geopm-report miniFE.report \
                                 -- ./miniFE.x -nx 256 -ny 256 -nz 256

## ENVIRONMENT
Every command line option to the launcher can also be specified as an
environment variable if desired (with the exception of `--geopm-ctl`).
For example, instead of specifying `--geopm-region-barrier` one can instead
set in the environment `GEOPM_REGION_BARRIER=true` prior to invoking the launcher
script.  The environment variables are named the same as the command
line option but have the hyphens replaced with underscores, and are
all uppercase.  The command line options take precedence over the
environment variables.

The usage of `--geopm-ctl` here is slightly different than how the
controller handles the `GEOPM_CTL` environment variable.  In the
case of the launcher, one can specify _process_, _pthread_, or
_application_ to the command line argument.  In the case of
`GEOPM_CTL` one can ONLY specify `process` or `pthread`, as
launching the controller as a separate application is handled through
the `geopmctl` binary.
