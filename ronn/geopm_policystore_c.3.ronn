## DESCRIPTION
These interfaces expose records of best known policies for profiles used with agents.
The records include the best reported policies, as well as the default policies
to apply when a best run has not yet been recorded.  Policies are shared as
arrays of doubles.  See `geopm_agent_policy_json_partial()` in **geopm_agent(3)**
for information about interpreting them as json strings.

  * `geopm_policystore_connect`():
    Connects to a data store at the path specified in _data_path_, creating a
    new one if necessary.  Returns zero on success, or an error code on failure.

  * `geopm_policystore_disconnect`():
    Disconnects the data store if one is connected.

  * `geopm_policystore_get_best`():
    Gets the best known policy for a given _profile_name_ and _agent_name_ in
    the policy store.  Gets the agent's default policy if no best policy has
    been reported.  Returns GEOPM_ERROR_INVALID if not connected to a store, or
    if _policy_vals_ would be truncated.  Returns GEOPM_ERROR_DATA_STORE if no
    applicable policy exists in the data store, or if any data store errors
    occur.  Returns zero on success, and up to _max_policy_vals_ values of the
    found policy are written to _policy_vals_.

  * `geopm_policystore_set_best`():
    Sets the best known policy for a given _profile_name_ and _agent_name_ to
    _policy_vals_ in the store.  _num_policy_vals_ specifies how many values to
    store.  Returns GEOPM_ERROR_INVALID if not connected to a store. Returns
    GEOPM_ERROR_DATA_STORE if any data store errors occur. Returns zero on
    success.

  * `geopm_policystore_set_default`():
    Sets the default policy for a given _agent_name_ to _policy_vals_ in
    the store.  _num_policy_vals specifies how many values to store. Returns
    GEOPM_ERROR_INVALID if not connected to a store.  Returns
    GEOPM_ERROR_DATA_STORE if any data store errors occur.  Returns zero on
    success.
