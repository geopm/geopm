## SYNOPSIS
**\#include [<geopm_time.h>](https://github.com/geopm/geopm/blob/dev/src/geopm_time.h)**

`Link with -lgeopm (MPI) or -lgeopmpolicy (non-MPI)`

  * `int geopm_time_string(`:
    `int` _buf_size_, <br>
    `char *`_buf_`);`

  * `int geopm_time_to_string(`:
    `const struct geopm_time_s *`_time_, <br>
    `int` _buf_size_, <br>
    `char *`_buf_`);`

  * `int geopm_time(`:
    `struct geopm_time_s *`_time_`);`

  * `double geopm_time_diff(`:
    `const struct geopm_time_s *`_begin_, <br>
    `const struct geopm_time_s *`_end_`);`

  * `bool geopm_time_comp(`:
    `const struct geopm_time_s *`_aa_, <br>
    `const struct geopm_time_s *`_bb_`);`

  * `void geopm_time_add(`:
    `const struct geopm_time_s *`_begin_, <br>
    `double` _elapsed_, <br>
    `struct geopm_time_s *`_end_`);`

  * `double geopm_time_since(`:
    `const struct geopm_time_s *`_begin_`);`

## DESCRIPTION
The _geopm_time.h_ header defines GEOPM interfaces for measuring time
in seconds relative to a fixed arbitrary reference point. The geopm_time_s
structure is used to hold time values.

  * `geopm_time_string`():
    Fills _buf_ with the current date and time as a string.  The
    string will be null-terminated and truncated to _buf_size_, which
    must be at least 26 characters as required by **asctime_r(3)**.

  * `geopm_time_to_string`():
    Fills _buf_ with the date and time indicated by the _time_
    structure converted to a string.  The string will be
    null-terminated and truncated to _buf_size_, which must be at
    least 26 characters as required by **asctime_r(3)**.

  * `geopm_time`():
    Sets _time_ to the current time.

  * `geopm_time_diff`():
    Returns the difference in seconds between _begin_ and _end_.

  * `geopm_time_comp`():
    Return true if _aa_ is less than _bb_.

  * `geopm_time_add`():
    Sets _end_ to _elapsed_ seconds after _begin_.

  * `geopm_time_since`():
    Returns the number of seconds elapsed between the current time and _begin_.
