## SYNOPSIS

`geopmanalysis` -t _ANALYSIS_TYPE_ -n _NUM_RANK_ -N _NUM_NODE_ [_OPTIONS_] -- _EXEC_ [_EXEC_ARGS_]

## DESCRIPTION
Used to run applications and analyze results for specific GEOPM use cases.
An application must be launched at least once to generate report files. When using
geopmanalysis to launch applications, it must be run within an allocation to
ensure that all runs use the same set of nodes. Once all the required reports
have been generated, the analysis can be rerun without needing an allocation
using the `--skip-launch` option.


## OPTIONS

* `-h`, `--help`:
  Show help message and exit.

* `-t`, `--analysis-type` _freq_sweep_|_balancer_|_offline_|_online_|_stream_mix_:
  The type of analysis to perform. _balancer_ analysis is not yet implemented.

* `-n`, `--num-rank` _NUM_RANKS_:
  Total number of application ranks to launch with. Because geopmanalysis
  uses the GEOPM launch method "process" there will be one extra rank launched
  per node in addition to the number of application ranks specified by this option.

* `-N`, `--num-node` _NUM_NODES_:
  Number of compute nodes to launch onto.  Note that this option is `not` propagated
  to the underlying launch application; for instance if ALPS is the application
  launch backend, this option does not specify the number of ranks per node.

* `-o`, `--output-dir` _OUTPUT_DIR_:
  The output directory for reports, traces, and plots (default: '.').

* `-p`, `--profile-prefix` _PREFIX_:
  Prefix to prepend to profile name when launching. Depending on the
  type of analysis, several profiles will be generated. For example,
  the freq_sweep analysis appends the frequency for each run to this
  prefix.

* `-l`, `--level` 0|1|2:
  Controls the level of detail provided in the analysis. <br>
    level 0: run application and generate reports and traces only <br>
    level 1: print analysis of report and trace data (default) <br>
    level 2: create plots from report and trace data

* `-s`, `--skip-launch`:
  Do not launch jobs, only analyze existing data.

* `--version`:
  Show the GEOPM version number and exit.

* `-v`, `--verbose`:
  Print verbose debugging information.

* `--geopm-ctl` _GEOPM_CTL_:
  Launch type for the GEOPM controller.  Available GEOPM_CTL values:
  process, pthread, or application (default 'process').

* `--iterations` _NUM_ITERATIONS_:
  Number of iterations to perform for every type of analysis.  E.g. for the
  OfflineFrequencyAnalysis, _NUM_ITERATIONS_ runs will be performed at every
  available frequency.  The data is averaged together prior to evaluating what
  the best per-region frequency is. (default: _1_)

* `--enable-turbo`:
  When calculating the best per region frequencies, this flag sipulates that frequencies
  in the turbo range should be considered.  By default, this flag is not set meaning
  frequencies in the turbo range are not considered.

## EXAMPLES
  Once the geopmpy modules are installed, you can invoke this utility directly from
  the command line.  You can either run the utility from inside a directory containing
  data, or from a remote directory.  Some examples follow:

  The _freq_sweep_ analysis type runs the application once at each available frequency
  on the platform. The reports generated from this analysis can be used for other types
  of analysis. The output from the frequency sweep is a mapping of the best-fit frequency
  for each region that saves energy while not letting the runtime increase more than 10%.

    geopmanalysis -n1 -N1 -t freq_sweep -p myprof -o myprof -- ./build/bin/geopmbench config.json

  The _offline_ analysis type runs a frequency sweep (if reports are not already present)
  to determine the best-fit frequency for each region of the application. Then it runs the
  application using the EfficientFreqDecider plugin, which uses this mapping to change the
  frequency when entering each reagion. The _online_ analysis type is similar except that
  it determines the best-fit frequency through online training.

    geopmanalysis -n1 -N1 -t offline -p myprof -o myprof -- ./build/bin/geopmbench config.json

  The _stream_mix_ analysis type uses the geopmbench application and varies the ratio
  between the runtimes of the stream and dgemm regions from around 20% stream to around 80%
  stream. For each ratio, it launches a frequency sweep and the offline and online analysis
  modes described above. The resulting analysis produces plots comparing the runtime and
  energy savings of the different plugin modes at each stream mix ratio.

    geopmanalysis -n1 -N1 -t stream_mix -p myprof -o myprof -- ./build/bin/geopmbench config.json
