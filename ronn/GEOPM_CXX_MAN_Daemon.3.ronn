## NAMESPACES

The `Daemon` class is a member of the `namespace geopm`, but the
full name, `geopm::Daemon`, has been abbreviated in this manual.
Similarly, the `std::` namespace specifier has been omitted from the
interface definitions for the following standard types: `std::vector`,
`std::string`, and `std::set`, to enable better rendering of this
manual.

Note that the `Daemon` class is an abstract base class.  There is one
concrete implementation, `DaemonImp`.

## SYNOPSIS

**\#include [<geopm/Daemon.hpp>](https://github.com/geopm/geopm/blob/dev/src/Daemon.hpp)**

`Link with -lgeopm` (MPI) or -lgeopmpolicy (non-MPI)`

  * `void update_endpoint_from_policystore(`:
    `double` _timeout_`);`

  * `void stop_wait_loop(`:
     `void);`

  * `void reset_wait_loop(`:
     `void);`

  * `unique_ptr<Daemon> make_unique(`:
    `const std::string &`_endpoint_name_`,` <br>
    `const std::string &`_db_path_`);`

## DESCRIPTION
The `Daemon` class is the underlying C++ implementation for the
**geopm_daemon_c(3)** C interface.  Please refer to the
**geopm_daemon_c(3)** man page for a general description of the
purpose, goals, and use cases for this interface.

## FACTORY METHOD
  * `make_unique`():

    This method returns a unique_ptr<Daemon> to a concrete DaemonImp
    object.  The shared memory prefix for the Endpoint should be given
    in _endpoint_name_.  The path to the PolicyStore should be given
    in _db_path_.

## CLASS METHODS

  * `update_endpoint_from_policystore`():
    looks up a policy in the Daemon's PolicyStore given the attached
    Controller's agent and profile name, and writes it back into the
    policy side of the Daemon's Endpoint.  If no policy is found, an
    error is returned.  If the Controller fails to attach within the
    _timeout_, or detaches while this function is running, no policy
    is written.

  * `stop_wait_loop`():
    exits early from any ongoing wait loops in the Daemon, for example
    in a call to `update_endpoint_from_policystore()`.

  * `reset_wait_loop`():
    resets the Daemon's endpoint to prepare for a future wait loop.

## ERRORS
All functions described on this man page throw **geopm::Exception(3)**
on error.
