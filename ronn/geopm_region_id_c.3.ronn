`Link with -lgeopm`

  * `int geopm_region_id_is_mpi(`:
    `uint64_t` _region_id_`);`

  * `int geopm_region_id_is_unmarked(`:
    `uint64_t` _region_id_`);`

  * `int geopm_region_id_hint_is_equal(`:

    `uint64_t` _region_id_`);`

  * `uint64_t geopm_region_id_hint(`:

## DESCRIPTION
The functions described here are intended to provide insight with regard
to the region being executed by a particular rank as served by the PlatformIO
`REGION_ID#` signal.  For more details regarding PlatformIO and signals please see
**geopm(7)**.

  * `geopm_region_id_is_mpi`():
    returns 1 if __region_id__ is currently executing an MPI operation,
    otherwise returns 0.

  * `geopm_region_id_is_unmarked`():
    returns 1 if __region_id__ is currently executing unmarked code,
    otherwise returns 0.

  * `geopm_region_id_hint_is_equal`():
    returns 1 if __region_id__ is associated with __hint_type__,
    otherwise returns 0.

  * `geopm_region_id_hint`():
    returns hint type that is associated with __region_id__.

  * `geopm_region_id_hash`():
    returns __region_id__ dissociated from hints.
