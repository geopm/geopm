## DESCRIPTION
This Agent is used to map predetermined optimal frequencies to named
regions.  The best frequencies for each region are specified in the
environment variable `GEOPM_FREQUENCY_MAP`, which is a JSON-formatted
string mapping region name to frequency in Hertz, e.g. '{"region1":
1.2e9, "region2": 1.5e9}'.  If a frequency for a region is not
specified, the region hint will be used and the frequency will be set
to either the minimum or maximum available frequency.  See
**geopm_prof_c(3)** for the list of region hints.  These best-fit
frequencies can be determined by running the application once at each
available frequency and checking the performance of each region.

## AGENT BEHAVIOR HIGHLIGHTS
Policies and samples are vectors of double precision values where each
value has a meaning defined by the **geopm::Agent(3)** implementation.
The Agent interface also provides methods for the Agent to extend
reports and traces with additional Agent-specific information.

* `Agent Name`:
  Set the `--geopm-agent` launch option or `GEOPM_AGENT` environment
  variable to "frequency_map" and the Controller will select the
  FrequencyMapAgent for its control handler.  See **geopmlaunch(1)** and
  **geopm(7)** for more information about launch options and
  environment variables.

* `Agent Policy Definitions`:
  The minimum and maximum frequency are passed down as policies.
  Setting both to the same value can be used to force the entire
  application to run at one frequency.

  `FREQ_MIN`: The minimum frequency that the algorithm is allowed to
              choose for any region.  If NAN is passed, it will use
              the minimum available frequency by default.

  `FREQ_MAX`: The maximum frequency that the algorithm is allowed to
              choose for any region.  If NAN is passed, it will use
              the maximum available frequency by default.


* `Agent Sample Definitions`:
  N/A

* `Trace Column Extensions`:
  N/A

* `Report Extensions`:
  The assigned frequency for each region is added to the report.

* `Control Loop Gate`:
  The agent gates the Controller's control loop to a cadence
  of 5ms.
