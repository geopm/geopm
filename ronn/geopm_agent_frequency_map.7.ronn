## DESCRIPTION
This Agent is used to map predetermined optimal frequencies to named
regions.  The best frequencies for each region are specified in the
environment variable `GEOPM_FREQUENCY_MAP`, which is a JSON-formatted
string mapping region name to frequency in Hertz, e.g. '{"region1":
1.2e9, "region2": 1.5e9}'.  If a frequency for a region is not
specified, the region hint will be used and the frequency will be set
to either the minimum or maximum available frequency.  See
**geopm_prof_c(3)** for the list of region hints.  These best-fit
frequencies can be determined by running the application once at each
available frequency and checking the performance of each region.

## AGENT BEHAVIOR HIGHLIGHTS
Policies and samples are vectors of double precision values where each
value has a meaning defined by the **geopm::Agent(3)** implementation.
The Agent interface also provides methods for the Agent to extend
reports and traces with additional Agent-specific information.

* `Agent Name`:
  Set the `--geopm-agent` launch option or `GEOPM_AGENT` environment
  variable to "frequency_map" and the Controller will select the
  FrequencyMapAgent for its control handler.  See **geopmlaunch(1)** and
  **geopm(7)** for more information about launch options and
  environment variables.

* `Agent Policy Definitions`:
  The minimum and maximum frequency are passed down as policies.
  Setting both to the same value can be used to force the entire
  application to run at one frequency.

  `FREQ_MIN`: The minimum frequency that the algorithm is allowed to
              choose for any region.  If NAN is passed, it will use
              the minimum available frequency by default.

  `FREQ_MAX`: The maximum frequency that the algorithm is allowed to
              choose for any region.  If NAN is passed, it will use
              the maximum available frequency by default.

  The rest of the policy consists of the map of per-region frequencies,
  in pairs of region hash and region frequency. For example, to set a policy
  with FREQ_MIN = 1 GHz, FREQ_MAX = 3 GHz, a mapped frequency of 2 GHz to
  region hash 0x1234abcd, and 2.5 GHz to 0x2468cdef, the following policy could
  be set: 1e9, 3e9, 0x1234abcd, 2e9, 0x2468cdef, 2.5e9

  To encode as a json string, include a series of HASH_{index}, FREQ_{index}
  pairs in the policy. Since json does not support hex literals, input the
  hashes in their decimal form. For example, the above policy would look like:
  { FREQ_MIN: 1e9, FREQ_MAX: 3e9, HASH_0: 305441741, FREQ_0: 2e9,
    HASH_1: 610848239, FREQ_1: 2.5e9 }

  The index values can be in the range of 0 to 30, inclusive. The order of
  index values does not matter, and gaps in index values are permitted. Multiple
  definitions of an index are not permitted, and multiple mappings of a region
  are not permitted.

  If the GEOPM_FREQUENCY_MAP environment variable specifies a frequency map,
  the policy only consists of FREQ_MIN and FREQ_MAX. GEOPM_FREQUENCY_MAP is
  deprecated and will no longer be used in a future release.


* `Agent Sample Definitions`:
  N/A

* `Trace Column Extensions`:
  N/A

* `Report Extensions`:
  The assigned frequency for each region is added to the report.

* `Control Loop Gate`:
  The agent gates the Controller's control loop to a cadence
  of 5ms.
