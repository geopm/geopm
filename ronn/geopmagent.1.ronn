## SYNOPSIS

`geopmagent` [`-a` _AGENT_] [`-p` _POLICY0_,_POLICY1_,...]

## DESCRIPTION

Used to get information about GEOPM agents on a system and create
static policies for those agents.
When no options are provided `geopmagent` will display the names of
all available agents.  When the agent is specified with option `-a`
but `-p` is not given, `geopmagent` will print names of the agent's
policies and samples.  If both `-a` and `-p` are provided then
`geopmagent` will print to standard output a JSON formatted policy
string corresponding to the policy values specified by the `-p`
option.  The argument to `-p` is a comma-separated list of policy
parameters.  To determine the parameter names and ordering
appropriate for the `-p` option, run `geopmagent` with only the `-a`
option and inspect the output line beginning with the string "Policy:".
The JSON formatted string can be
piped to a file to be used as the `GEOPM_POLICY` as described in
**geopm(7)** to provide a static input policy for the GEOPM
controller.  If `-p` is given, but `-a` is not an error is reported.

## OPTIONS
  * `--help`:
    Print brief summary of the command line usage information,
    then exit.

  * `--version`:
    Print version of **geopm(7)** to standard output, then exit.

  * `-a` _AGENT_:
    Specify the name of the agent.

  * `-p` _POLICY0_,_POLICY1_,...:
    The values to be set for each policy in a comma-separated list.

## EXAMPLES
List all available agents on the system:

    $ geopmagent
    monitor
    power_balancing
    freq_efficient

Get power_balancing agent policy and sample names:

    $ geopmagent -a power_balancing
    Policy: POWER
    Sample: POWER,IS_CONVERGED,EPOCH_RUNTIME

Create policy for power_balancing agent with 250 Watts per node power
budget:

    $ geopmagent -a power_balancing -p 250
    {"POWER" : 250}
