## DESCRIPTION
The functions described here enable application feedback to the GEOPM
control algorithm for identifying regions of code, progress within
regions, and iterations through loops that contain inter-node
synchronization points in the application.  Regions of code define
periods in the application during which control parameters are tuned
with the expectation that control parameters for a region can be
optimized independently of other regions.  In this way a region is
associated with a set of control parameters which can be optimized,
and future time intervals associated with the same region will benefit
from the application of control parameters which were determined from
tuning within previous occurrences of the region.  There are two
competing motivations for defining a region within the application.
The first is to identify a section of code that has distinct compute,
memory or network characteristics.  The second is to avoid defining
these regions such that they are nested within each other, as nested
regions are ignored, and only the outer most region is used for tuning
when nesting occurs.  Identifying progress within a region can be used
to alleviate load imbalance in the application under the assumption
that the region is bulk synchronous.  Under the assumption that the
application employs an iterative algorithm which synchronizes
periodically the user can alleviate load imbalance on larger time
scales than the regions provide.  This is done by marking iterations
through an outer loop in the application, the "epoch".

`WARNING:` All of the functions described herein require that MPI has
been initialized (via MPI_Init() or MPI_Init_thread()) and is properly
functioning before they are invoked.  These functions make use of various
MPI calls in their implementations and will return errors if MPI is not
initialized.

  * `geopm_prof_region`():
    registers an application region.  The _region_name_ and _hint_ are
    input parameters, and the _region_id_ is output.  The _region_id_
    can be used with `geopm_prof_enter`() and `geopm_prof_exit`() to
    reference the region.  If the region name has been previously
    registered, a call to this function will set the _region_id_ but
    the state associated with the region is unmodified.  The
    _region_name_ is used to determine the output _region_id_ and is
    also displayed in the profiling report to identify the region.
    The _hint_ is one of the values given by the geopm_region_hint_e
    enum defined in _geopm.h_ which determines the initial control
    settings.  The following hints are supported:

    `GEOPM_REGION_HINT_UNKNOWN`: <br>
    Default value, provides no hint to the runtime.

    `GEOPM_REGION_HINT_COMPUTE`: <br>
    Compute limited region.

    `GEOPM_REGION_HINT_MEMORY`: <br>
    Memory bandwidth bound region.

    `GEOPM_REGION_HINT_NETWORK`: <br>
    Inter-node network dominated region, default for unnested MPI
    calls.  User defined regions that have this hint will have the MPI
    time spent within this region attributed to the region as whole
    for the periods of time when all ranks are within an MPI function.

    `GEOPM_REGION_HINT_IO`: <br>
    Disk input/output dominated region.

    `GEOPM_REGION_HINT_SERIAL`: <br>
    Calculation that is not executed by a multi-threaded process (may
    be multi-process).

    `GEOPM_REGION_HINT_PARALLEL`: <br>
    Calculation that is executed by a multi-threaded process in a
    hybrid thread/process parallelism (e.g. MPI + OpenMP).

    `GEOPM_REGION_HINT_IGNORE`: <br>
    Region that control algorithms should ignore, and/or apply default
    policies.  This hint should be applied to application start up,
    shutdown, and events that do not happen on every trip through the
    outer loop.

  * `geopm_prof_enter`():
    is called by the compute application to mark the beginning of the
    profiled compute region associated with the _region_id_. If this
    call is made after entering a different region, but before exiting
    that region, the call is ignored and an error code is returned
    (i.e. nested regions are ignored).

  * `geopm_prof_exit`():
    is called by the compute application to mark the end of a compute
    region.  If this region is nested then the call is ignored and an
    error code is returned.

  * `geopm_prof_epoch`():
    is called once for each pass through a computational loop
    containing inter-node synchronization events.  This call acts as a
    beacon signal emitted by each MPI rank as it begins a loop
    iteration.  The divergence in the elapsed time between calls by
    different MPI ranks is interpreted as an imbalance to be corrected
    by the runtime.  This function may be called at different places
    in an application, but it should not be used to mark a loop that
    is nested inside of another loop which is also marked.  All calls
    to `geopm_prof_epoch`() made inside of a user defined region with
    the `GEOPM_REGION_HINT_IGNORE` hint bit set will be ignored.

  * `geopm_tprof_init`():
    resets the thread progress and updates the total work for a
    threaded region.  Along with `geopm_tprof_post()`, it provides a
    way for threads to report progress within a region.  This should
    be called by all threads with _num_work_unit_, the total number of
    work units to be completed by all threads after entering a thread
    parallel region.  The total work units corresponds to the number
    of times that the `geopm_tprof_post`() interface will be called by
    any thread to report progress within the region.

  * `geopm_tprof_post`():
    is called after a thread has completed each work unit to report
    progress.  This method signals the completion of one work unit out
    of the total passed to `geopm_tprof_init()`.
