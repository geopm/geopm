## DESCRIPTION

The behavior of this agent is described in more detail in the
**geopm_agent_power_balancer(7)** man page.  The balancing algorithm
is implemented using the **geopm::PowerBalancer(3)** class.


## CLASS METHODS
  * `PowerBalancerAgent`():
    The power cap enforced on average over all
    nodes running the application.  This has
    value 0.0 except in two cases.  In the
    first case this is the M_SEND_DOWN_LIMIT
    step at the beginning of the application
    run.  This value will also be non-zero in
    the case where the resource mananger has
    requested a new budget for the application,
    and thus, the algorithm must be restarted
    at step M_SEND_DOWN_LIMIT.
    Step that the root is providing a policy
    for.  The parent has received a sample
    matching this step in the last walk up the
    tree, execpt in the case where the endpoint
    has recently been updated with a new
    policy, in this case the step will be
    M_SEND_DOWN_LIMIT and the policy indexed by
    M_POLICY_POWER_CAP will have a non-zero
    value.
    The largest runtime reported by any leaf
    agent since the last redistribution of
    power.  This will have value 0.0 until all
    leaf agents have reported a runtime to the
    root agent.
    This value is updated in step
    M_STEP_ADJUST_LIMIT to the amount that each
    leaf agent should increase their power
    limit by calling:
    power_cap(current_limit + slack)
    by before starting the algorithm over again
    at step M_STEP_MEASURE_RUNTIME.  For all
    other steps this value is 0.0.
    Number of steps in each iteration of the
    balancing algorithm.
    The the step counter that is currently in
    execution.  Note that the step is equal to
    the step counter modulo M_NUM_STEP and is
    reset each time a new power cap is provided
    by sending a policy with a non-zero
    M_POLICY_POWER_CAP field.
    Maximum expected runtime for any node
    below.
    The sum of all slack power available from
    children below the agent.
    Smallest difference between maximum power
    limit and current power limit for any node
    below.
    Number of elements in a sample vector.
