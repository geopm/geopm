## SYNOPSIS

**\#include [<geopm/EnergyEfficientAgent.hpp>](https://github.com/geopm/geopm/blob/dev/src/EnergyEfficientAgent.hpp)**

`Link with -lgeopm (MPI) or -lgeopmpolicy (non-MPI)`

## DESCRIPTION

The behavior of this agent is described in more detail in the
**geopm_agent_energy_efficient(7)** man page.  The core of the
online algorithm is implemented in **geopm::EnergyEfficientRegion(3)**.

For more details on the implementation, see the doxygen
page at <https://geopm.github.io/dox/classgeopm_1_1_energy_efficient_agent.html>.
