    ///        condition is true.
    ///
    /// There are many monotonically increasing signals provided by
    /// PlatformIO, for example: ENERGY_PACKAGE, CYCLES_THREAD, and
    /// CYCLES_REFERENCE.  It is useful to track the amount that these
    /// signals increase while a condition is true.  In the common
    /// case, the condition is that the application is executing a
    /// particular region of code.  An example use for a
    /// SumAccumulator object is to track the increase in the amount
    /// of package energy consumed while the application was executing
    /// a particular region.
    ///
    /// The SumAccumulator is used to accumulate a signal that is
    /// monotonically increasing, e.g. energy, in order to track the
    /// portion of the total increase that occurred while the condition
    /// is true, e.g. while the application was executing a particular
    /// region.
    ///
    /// Each of these objects is specific to a signal, and it is also
    /// particular to a condition that is being tracked.  This
    /// condition may be: the application is executing a particular
    /// profiled region, or the hint signal has a particular value.  The
    /// user only calls the update() method when the condition is true
    /// (e.g. the application is within the tracked region).  The
    /// enter() and exit() API's are used to track values for the last
    /// occurrence of the condition being true.  It is expected
