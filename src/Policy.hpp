    /// Policy encapsulates creating, comparing, and displaying Agent
    /// policies.  A Policy is created with default values for each
    /// field, then later updated with different values as needed.  A
    /// value of NAN indicates that the default should be used.
    ///
    /// Short-term plan: use Policy at "edges" of the runtime and in
    ///     some commandline tools to handle JSON conversions,
    ///     comparisons, filling in NAN as needed.  The main
    ///     Controller loop and Agent interaction remains the same.
    ///     The Agent::validate_policy() method will be used to determine
    ///     default values.
    ///
    /// Long-term plan: extend the Agent interface to use Policy in
    ///     place of vectors of doubles.  Agents will be required to
    ///     provide a function returning a Policy with the default
    ///     values set.  The validate_policy() method will be
    ///     simplified to do validation & clamping only, not replace
    ///     NAN with default.  The TreeComm interface remains the same
    ///     and the Controller will handle converting Policy to vector
    ///     and vice versa.
    ///
    /// To be finalized: new agent API (v2.0) & changes to Controller
    ///     Policy MyAgent::default_policy(void)
    ///     static Policy Agent::default_policy(agent_name) // calls into agent_factory
    ///     vector<Policy> Agent::split_policy(Policy)
    ///     void Agent::adjust_platform(Policy)
    ///     void Agent::validate_policy(Policy) //no longer does NAN replacement
    ///
    /// Example:
    ///     Policy pol = Agent::default_policy("energy_efficient");
    ///     // pol is {1.0e9, 2.1e9, 0.10, 2.1e9}
