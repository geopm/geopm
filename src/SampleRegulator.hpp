    ///
    /// The SampleRegulator class is a functor used by the Controller
    /// to create coherent samples while merging data collected from
    /// the Platform and the ProfileSampler.  The ProfileSampler
    /// progress and runtime data is collected asynchronously by each
    /// MPI rank whenever the application MPI ranks use the Profile
    /// interface.  The Platform sample comprises a vector of doubles
    /// collected synchronously.  The cadence of the Platform samples
    /// is determined by the Controller.  The application progress and
    /// runtime data for the region are written some time prior to the
    /// collection of the Platform sample and each have an associated
    /// time stamp.  The SampleRegulator extrapolates the application
    /// provided progress and runtime for each MPI rank to the time
    /// when the Platform was sampled.  The extrapolated application
    /// data is then bundled with the hardware data.  This bundled
    /// data is transformed into a basis that linearly combines
    /// measurements of the same metric so that the combination is
    /// representative of the given metric for each domain of control.
    /// This transformation matrix is an input which is provided by
    /// the Platform.
    ///
    /// The class is a functor and has only one public member
    /// function, the operator ().  This class has been separated from
    /// the Controller to encapsulate this one operation and
    /// facilitate independent testing of this feature.  The
    /// operator () method is broken down into four steps, each
    /// represented by a private method, this enables individual
    /// testing of each step.
