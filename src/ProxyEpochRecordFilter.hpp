    ///        other events.
    ///
    /// This filter is used to insert synthetic epoch events into the
    /// stream received by an application process.  This provides
    /// users of the ApplicationSampler with epoch events even if the
    /// application does not provide them directly through calls to
    /// geopm_prof_epoch().  When this filter is selected, any epoch
    /// events that arrive though the application calls into
    /// geopm_prof_epoch() are removed from the record stream.  The
    /// output of this filter is a pass through of all non-epoch
    /// events and may include synthesized epoch events.  The epoch
    /// events are synthesized from region entry of a specified region
    /// that may be detected through runtimes like MPI function calls
    /// or OpenMP parallel regions.  This proxy-region is specified at
    /// filter construction time by the region hash.  Typically, this
    /// region hash value is determined by inspection of a report from
    /// a previous run.  There are two other constructor parameters
    /// that enable support for multiple proxy-region entries per
    /// outer loop, and for application calls into the proxy-region
    /// prior to the beginning of the outer loop.  The filter assumes
    /// that the provided records have been collected from a single
    /// process.
