    /// The ProfileTable container uses a block of virtual address

    /// intended to support references which are registered once and
    /// used multiple times.  The registering of a reference requires a
    /// string name as input and provides a randomized hash of the
    /// string to an unsigned 64 bit integer key.  The key is then
    /// used for subsequent references to the struct geopm_prof_message_s supported
    /// by the container.  The ProfileTable is optimized for many
    /// writers and one reader who scans the entire table by calling
    /// ProfileTable::dump(), however it can support other use
    /// cases as well.  The buffer that is used to store the data is
    /// provided at creation time.  This buffer can have any number of
    /// operating system memory policies applied including
    /// inter-process shared memory.  See the geopm::SharedMemory
