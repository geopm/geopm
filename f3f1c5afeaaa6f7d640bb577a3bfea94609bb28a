I opted to follow the existing name on #609 since that matches the column name that is eventually added to the dataframe.\n\nIt is only used at #745-#748. This line isn\u0027t really necessary since all places where it matters are short-circuited out in the only case where they would result in an exception (where the value they aim to cache is absent in the first report in a file).",
