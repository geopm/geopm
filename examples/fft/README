A variation on NPB FT hybrid version that uses dynamic memory
allocation and creates a single binary that can used with multiple
numbers of MPI ranks.  The original version builds specific binaries
(ft.C.2, ft.C.4, etc.) for different MPI runs.

There is a few percent performance degradation compared to the orginal
version with static memory allocation.

To build and run:

make class=C
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 mpirun -n 1 ./ft.C
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 mpirun -n 2 ./ft.C
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 mpirun -n 4 ./ft.C
OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 mpirun -n 2 ./ft.C

etc.
