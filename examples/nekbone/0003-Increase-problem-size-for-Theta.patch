Subject: [PATCH 3/3] Increase problem size for Theta.

- Increase iterations (iter) to 2000.  Nek5k might run for 12 hours
  after a few minutes in setup.
- Increase lp and lelt to 262144 and 6200, respectively.
  + lp calculation: This is the maximum number of nodes that could
  possibly be utilized multiplied by the number of CPU cores on each
  node.  On Theta that's 4096 nodes * 64 cores = 262144.
  + lelt calculation: It's recommended to have 100 elements per core on
  KNL.  The number of cores/threads desired impacts the elements per
  core calculation.  On a 64 core system where 1 core is left free for
  the OS, and 1 core is left free for the GEOPM Controller, 62 cores
  remain.  62 * 100 = 6200.
- Set poly. order range to only solve 12th order case.  Nek5k would only
  solve a single order.
- Nekbone is not sensitive to the node count, but it's generally best if
  the rank count can be factored into three numbers.
- Information obtained from nekbone maintainer at Argonne: sparker <at>
