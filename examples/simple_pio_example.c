# Script bootstraps the example below (simple_pio_example.c)
#
# This example is designed for a systems programmer who wants to build
# geopm::PlatformIO with as few dependencies as possible and make use
# of the geopm_pio_* andn geopm_topo_* interfaces.  This build does
# not have any HPC requirements and should run on any standard Linux
# install that has autotools and a compiler.
#
# The program prints the amount of energy used by package 0 in units
# of joules.
