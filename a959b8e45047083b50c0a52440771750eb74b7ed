      "message": "The only place that m_is_in_outer is set to false is in the initializer list for the Controller.  This seems to only be used to handle the very first call to update_outer_sync.  Every other call has it set to true.\n\nI think m_is_in_outer could be removed as a member variable, and instead declared as a static int in this specific method.  It\u0027s more of a one-shot thing anyway.",
