<h4>Note on Legends:</h4>
<p>The age and cumulative plot legends show each bug as the
combination of the three bug labels applied to it.  These labels are
three pairs of two letters separated by a dash. The first of each pair
describes the category: 'q' for quality, 'p' for priority and 'e' for
exposure.  The second of each pair describes the bug having a high or
low indicator for the category: 'h' or 'l'.  For example the label
'qh-pl-el' describes a bug with high quality, low priority and low
exposure.</p>
