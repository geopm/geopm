* Fri Dec 21 2018 Christopher M. Cantalupo <christopher.m.cantalupo@intel.com> v1.0.0-rc1
- Release overview:
- This is the first candidate for the v1.0.0 release of the GEOPM package.
- The version 1.0 is significant in that semantic versioning https://semver.org/ is intended for all subsequent releases.
- The APIs defined by all installed header files and the documented behavior of those interfaces shall remain compatible with linking applications until version 2.0.
- The documented definition for all built in signals and controls supported by PlatformIO is not intended to change prior to version 2.0.
- Expected changes prior to v1.0.0 release:
- The documentation included in this release candidate will be improved upon prior to the actual v1.0.0 release.
- Man pages which currently link to doxygen will be filled in.
- The definition of the high order bits in the REGION_ID# signal supported by PlatformIO may be changed in the way documented in the PlatformIO(3) man page to split into two signals (REGION_ID AND REGION_HINT).
- It is possible that interface classes currently prefixed with "I" may be renamed to exclude the "I" (e.g. IPlatformIO -> PlatformIO).
- In this case the concrete implementation would be appended with "Imp" (e.g. PlatformIO -> PlatformIOImp).
- The appearance of the epoch signal in the REGION_ID column of the trace will be removed.
- The EPOCH_COUNT signal will be added to the default set of traced signals to enable tracking of epoch calls.

- These have been replaced by the PlatformIO / IOGroup / Agent class interactions.
- The Kontroller object which was supporting the new code path has been renamed Controller.

- New Slack channel <https://geopm.slack.com>
- New Code of Conduct
- New pull request template
- Contributing instructions updated with details of gerrit review process.
- Modified implementations and interfaces:
- Major refactor of the controller and plugin architecture is provided as an optional new code path.
- Most of the changes made to the implementation for this release modify the new code path.
- The old code path is still available for users as long as the controller is run without the GEOPM_AGENT environment variable set.
- The new code path will be active if the user selects an agent by name with the GEOPM_AGENT environment variable when launching the controller.
- The old code path is maintained in the current Controller object along with the the Decider / Platform / PlatformImp plugins.
- The new code path is maintained in a replacement for the Controller which has been temporarily named the Kontroller.
- The Kontroller will be renamed the Controller after this release, and the old code path will no longer be available.
- Similar to the Kontroller/Controller replacement, the KprofileIOGroup KprofileIOSample and KruntimeRegulator are temporary replacements for their non-K counterparts and will be renamed.
- The beta release enables a new set of plugin interfaces named the IOGroup, Agent, and Comm.
- It is through the IOGroup, Agent and Comm plugins that the GEOPM runtime can be extended.
- The Decider / Platform / PlatformImp plugin extensions are deprecated and will be removed after this release.
- The IOGroup plugin enables a user to add new signal and control mechanisms for an Agent to read and write.
- The Agent plugin enables a user to add new monitor and control algorithms to the GEOPM runtime.
- MPI use by the GEOPM runtime which is not linked by application has been completely encapsulated in the Comm object.
- The tutorial has been extended with two new directories: tutorial/agent and tutorial/iogroup.
- The tutorial/iogroup directory documents how to write an IOGroup plugin.
- The tutorial/agent directory documents how to write an Agent plugin.
- The interface to the resource manager has been made much more flexible for supporting the new Agent interfaces.
- The resource manager interface is documented in the geopm_agent_c(3) and geopm_endpoint_c(3) man pages.
- Additionally command line tools have been proposed and partially implemented to support the interfaces documented in those man pages.
- The geopm_agent_c(3) APIs and geopmagent(1) CLI has software support.
- The endpoint interfaces are a work in progress that has not yet been integrated into the mainline source.
- The PlatformIO object provides the interface to the IOGroups.
- The PlatformIO C++ object will soon have an associated C interface documented as geopm_platformio_c(3).
- The geopmread and geopmwrite provide a CLI to the PlatformIO features.
- Introducing the MSRIOGroup which provides an implementation of the IOGroup for MSRs.
- Introducing the TimeIOGroup which provides an IOGroup for the time signal.
- Introducing the CpuinfoIOGroup which provides data from /proc/cpuinfo as signals.
- Introducing the ProfileIOGroup which provides profile data collected from the main compute application through the geopm_prof_c(3) APIs.
- The release includes three new installed binaries: geopmread, geopmwrite, and geopmagent.
- Each of these command line interfaces is documented with a man page and there is a man page for a future command line tool called geopmendpoint.

- Introducing the first three Agent implementations: MonitorAgent, PowerBalancerAgent, and EnergyEfficientAgent.
- Introducing PlatformTopo, replacement for PlatformTopology.
- Introducing DefaultProfile singleton which supports geopm_prof_c(3) APIs for profiling.
- Added documentation for monitor, energy_efficient, and power_balancer Agents, but the implementation is not currently aligned.
- The monitor agent is implemented and fully featured.
- The energy_efficient agent will soon be extended to match the man page, and currently use of the network is not enabled.
- The existing implementation of the energy_efficient agent does currently provide similar functionality to the efficient_freq Decider.
- The power_balancer agent is a work in progress that is not well aligned with the man page, but will be feature complete soon.
- Reports and traces generated by Agent code path are designed to be backward compatible with reports and traces generated with the Decider code path.
- New environment variables documented in geopm(7): GEOPM_ENDPOINT, GEOPM_AGENT, GEOPM_TRACE_SIGNALS, and GEOPM_DISABLE_HYPERTHREADS.
- Remove GEOPM_ERROR_AFFINITY_IGNORE environment variable, no longer required for testing.
- New plugin registration mechanism has been put in place and new factory has been implemented.
- Replace independent factories with single templated class the PluginFactory.
- No longer register a plugin using a half instantiated object.
- Removed call to dlsym, and plugins now use __attribute__((constructor)) to specify a callback target used when plugin is loaded.
- In this callback the plugin should register with its respective factory.
- Each plugin type has a make_plugin() static method that creates the plugin object and returns a pointer to the base class.
- The make_plugin() function pointer is what is registered with the factory.
- Extend the PluginFactory to require a the registration of a dictionary (map<string,string>) to enable queries of plugin capabilities.
- Use stricter criterion for selecting plugin files to load, name must be of the form libgeopmpi*.so.0.0.0 where 0.0.0 is the GEOPM ABI version.
