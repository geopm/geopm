* Thu May 24 2018 Christopher M. Cantalupo <christopher.m.cantalupo@intel.com> v0.5.0
- GEOPM beta release!
- Community updates:
- New landing page <https://geopm.github.io>
- New slack channel <https://geopm.slack.com>
- New Code of Conduct
- New pull request template
- Contributing instructions updated with details of gerrit review process.
- Modified implementations and interfaces:
- Major refactor of the controller and plugin architecture is provided as an optional new code path.
- The old code path is still available for users as long as the controller is run without the GEOPM_AGENT environment variable set.
- The new code path will be active if the user selects an agent by name with the GEOPM_AGENT environment variable when launching the controller.
- The old code path is maintained in the current Controller object along with the the Decider / Platform / PlatformImp plugins.
- The new code path is maintained in a replacement for the Controller which has been temporarily named the Kontroller.
- The Kontroller will be renamed the Controller after this release, and the old code path will no longer be available.
- Similar to the Kontroller/Controller replacement, the KprofileIOGroup KprofileIOSample and KruntimeRegulator are temporary replacements for their non-K counterparts and will be renamed.
- The beta release enables a new set of plugin interfaces named the IOGroup, Agent, and Comm.
- It is through the IOGroup, Agent and Comm plugins that the GEOPM runtime can be extended.
- The Decider / Platform / PlatformImp plugin extensions are deprecated and will be removed after this release.
- The IOGroup plugin enables a user to add new signal and control mechanisms for an Agent to read and write.
- The Agent plugin enables a user to add new monitor and control algorithms to the GEOPM runtime.
- MPI use by the GEOPM runtime which is not linked by application has been completely encapsulated in Comm object.
- A tutorial has been extended with two new directories: tutorial/agent and tutorial/iogroup.
- The tutorial/iogroup directory documents how to write an IOGroup plugin.
- The tutorial/agent directory documents how to write an Agent plugin.
- The interface to the resource manager has been made much more flexible for supporting the new Agent interfaces.
- The resource manager interface is documented in the geopm_agent_c(3) and geopm_endpoint_c(3) man pages.
- Additionally command line tools have been implemented/proposed to support the interfaces documented in those man pages.
- The geopm_agent_c APIs and geopmagent CLI has software support.
- The endpoint interfaces are a work in progress that has not yet been integrated into the mainline source.
- The PlatformIO object provides the interface to the IOGroups.
- The PlatformIO C++ object will soon have an associated C interface documented as geopm_platformio_c(3).
- The geopmread and geopmwrite provide a CLI to the PlatformIO features.
- Introducing the MSRIOGroup an implementation of the IOGroup for MSRs.
- Introducing the TimeIOGroup providing an IOGroup for the time signal.
- The release includes three new installed binaries: geopmread, geopmwrite, and geopmagent.
- Each of these command line interfaces is documented with a man page and there is a man page for a future command line tool called geopmendpoint.
- Deprecated geopm_policy_*() interfaces that have been replaced with the geopm_agent_*() and geopm_endpoint_*() APIs.
- Introduced the first three Agent implementations: MonitorAgent PowerBalancerAgent and EnergyEfficientAgent.
- Added documentation for monitor, energy_efficient, and power_balancer Agents, but the implementation is not currently aligned.
- The monitor agent is implemented and fully featured.
- The energy_efficient agent will soon be extended to match the man page, and currently use of the network is not enabled.
- The existing implementation of the energy_efficient agent does currently provide similar functionality to the efficient_freq Decider.
- The power_balancer agent is a work in progress that is not well aligned with the man page, but will be feature complete soon.
- Reports and traces generated by Agent code path are designed to be backward compatible with reports and traces generated with the Decider code path.
- New environment variables documented in geopm(7): GEOPM_ENDPOINT, GEOPM_AGENT, GEOPM_TRACE_SIGNALS, and GEOPM_DISABLE_HYPERTHREADS.
- Remove GEOPM_ERROR_AFFINITY_IGNORE environment variable, no longer required for testing.
- New plugin registration mechanism has been put in place and new factory has been implemented.
- Replace independent factories with single templated class the PluginFactory.
- No longer register a plugin using a half instantiated object.
- Removed call to dlsym, and plugins now use __attribute__((constructor)) to specify a callback target used when plugin is loaded.
- In this callback the plugin should register with its respective Factory.
- Each plugin type has a make_plugin() static method that creates the plugin object and returns a pointer to the base class.
- The make_plugin() function pointer is what is registered with the factory.
- Extend the PluginFactory to require a the registration of a dictionary (map<string,string>) to enable queries of plugin capabilities.
- Use stricter criterion for selecting plugin files to load, name must be of the form libgeopmpi*.so.0.0.0 where 0.0.0 is the GEOPM ABI version.
