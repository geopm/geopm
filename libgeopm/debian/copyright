 The Google C++ Testing and Mocking Framework (Google Test)
 .
 This header file defines the public API for Google Test.  It should be
 included by any test program that uses Google Test.
 .
 IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to limitation of the C++ language, we have to
 leave some internal implementation details in this header file.
 They are clearly marked by comments like this:
 .
 // INTERNAL IMPLEMENTATION - DO NOT USE IN A USER PROGRAM.
 .
 Such code is NOT meant to be used by a user directly, and is subject
 to CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.  Therefore DO NOT DEPEND ON IT in a user
 program!
 .
 Acknowledgment: Google Test borrowed the idea of automatic test
 registration from Barthelemy Dagenais' (barthelemy@prologique.com)
 easyUnit framework.

 A sample program demonstrating using Google C++ testing framework.
 .
 In this example, we use a more advanced feature of Google Test called
 test fixture.
 .
 A test fixture is a place to hold objects and functions shared by
 all tests in a test case.  Using a test fixture avoids duplicating
 the test code necessary to initialize and cleanup those common
 objects for each test.  It is also useful for defining sub-routines
 that your tests need to invoke a lot.
 .
 <TechnicalDetails>
 .
 The tests share the test fixture in the sense of code sharing, not
 data sharing.  Each test is given its own fresh copy of the
 fixture.  You cannot expect the data modified by one test to be
 passed on to another test, which is a bad idea.
 .
 The reason for this design is that tests should be independent and
 repeatable.  In particular, a test should not fail as the result of
 another test's failure.  If one test depends on info produced by
 another test, then the two tests should really be one big test.
 .
 The macros for indicating the success/failure of a test

 will define an action with the given name that executes the
 statements.  The value returned by the statements will be used as
 the return value of the action.  Inside the statements, you can

 Each TEST() expands to some static registration logic.  GCC puts all
 such static initialization logic for a translation unit in a common,
 internal function.  Since Google's build system restricts how much
 stack space a function can use, there's a limit on how many TEST()s
 one can put in a single C++ test file.  This test ensures that a large
 number of TEST()s can be defined in the same translation unit.

 A sample program demonstrating using Google C++ testing framework.
 .
 This sample shows how to write a more complex unit test for a class
 that has multiple member functions.
 .
 Usually, it's a good idea to have one test for each method in your
 class.  You don't have to do that exactly, but it helps to keep
 your tests organized.  You may also throw in additional tests as
 needed.

 This sample teaches how to reuse a test fixture in multiple test
 cases by deriving sub-fixtures from it.
 .
 When you define a test fixture, you specify the name of the test
 case that will use this fixture.  Therefore, a test fixture can
 be used by only one test case.
 .
 Sometimes, more than one test cases may want to use the same or
 slightly different test fixtures.  For example, you may want to
 make sure that all tests for a GUI library don't leak important
 system resources like fonts and brushes.  In Google Test, you do
 this by putting the shared logic in a super (as in "super class")
 test fixture, and then have each test case use a fixture derived
 from this super fixture.

 This file tests that:
 a. A header file defining a mock class can be included in multiple
 translation units without causing a link error.
 b. Actions and matchers can be instantiated with identical template
 arguments in different translation units without causing link
 errors.
 The following constructs are currently tested:
 Actions:
 Return()
 Return(value)
 ReturnNull
 ReturnRef
 Assign
 SetArgPointee

 .
       "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
       transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
       not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
       and conversions to other media types.
 .
       "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
       Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
       copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
       (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
 .
       "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
       form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
       editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
       represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
       of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
       separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
       the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
 .
       "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
       the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
       to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
       submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
       or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
       the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
       means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
       to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
       communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
       and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
       Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but

       designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
 .
       "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
       on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
       subsequently incorporated within the Work.
 .
     2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
       copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
       publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
       Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 .
     3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
       this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
       worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
       (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
       use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
       where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
       as of the date such litigation is filed.
 .
     4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
       meet the following conditions:
 .
       (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
           Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 .
       (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
           stating that You changed the files; and
 .
       (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
           that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
           the Derivative Works; and
 .
       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
           as modifying the License.
 .
       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
       the conditions stated in this License.
 .
     5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 .
     6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 .
     7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 .
     8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 .
     9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
