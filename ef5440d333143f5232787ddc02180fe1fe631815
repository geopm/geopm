I believe the empty braces means zero init everything in C++.",

      "message": "I used geopm_time_comp() but I don\u0027t completely understand how this function works. It seems like it returns true when aa \u003c bb. Maybe it would make more sense if it acted like \u003c\u003d\u003e, if 0 means equal. Or is this intended to be used only as \u003c ?  If so I think there are some other places in another patch where I made the wrong assumption.",
