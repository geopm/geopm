        The creation of a session is the first step that a client
        thread makes to interact with the GEOPM service.  Each Linux
        thread has a unique PID, and this PID can be associated with
        at most one GEOPM service session.  The session is ended by
        passing the client PID to the close_session() method.  The
        session will also be ended if the client thread terminates for
        any reason.

        The client PID may attempt to open a new session multiple
        times.  In this case a reference count records the number of
        calls to open the session by the client PID.  Each call to
        open a session is expected to be paired with a call to close
        the session.  When the reference count falls to zero, all
        resources associated with the session are released.

        Incrementing the reference count is an abstraction for the
        client.  The client itself cannot have more than a single open
        connection at once, so when requesting a new session, other
        than incrementing the counter, nothing else happens.

        All sessions are opened in read-mode, and may later be
        promoted to write-mode.  This promotion will occur with the
        first successful call requiring access to controls.  This
        includes any calls to write_control() or calls to
        start_batch() with a non-empty control_config.  These calls
        will fail if there is an active write-mode session opened by
        another thread.

        Prior to being promoted to write-mode, the current value for
        all controls that are supported by the GEOPM service will be
        recorded.  This record enables the service to restore all
        controls when the write-mode session ends.

        Permissions for the session's access to signals and controls
        are determined based on the policy for the user when
        the session is first opened.  Calling the set_group_access()
        method to alter the policy will not affect active sessions.
