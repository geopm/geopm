Summary
-------

The Global Extensible Open Power Manager (GEOPM) is a framework for
exploring power and energy optimizations on heterogeneous platforms.

With GEOPM you can:

- Interact with hardware settings and sensors using a
  platform-agnostic interface
- Restore changes to hardware settings when configuring process
  terminates
- Profile applications to study their power and energy behavior
- Automatically detect MPI and OpenMP phases in an application
- Optimize MPI applications to improve energy efficiency or reduce the
  effects of work imbalance, system jitter, and manufacturing variation
  through built-in control algorithms
- Develop your own runtime control algorithms through the extensible
  plugin architecture


Repository Organization
-----------------------

The GEOPM repository supports two software packages: the
`geopm-service` package and the `geopm` package.  The `geopm-service`
package provides a Linux systemd service.  The `geopm` package
provides a runtime for distrubted HPC applications.

- A build of the `geopm-service` package is required to build and run
  the `geopm` HPC runtime

- All `geopm-service` package features may be used independently of
  the features provided by the `geopm` package

- All run and build requirements of the `geopm-service` package are
  provided by commony used Linux distributions

- The run and build requirements of the `geopm` package include
  several additional HPC specific dependencies


GEOPM Service
-------------

The files supporting the `geopm-service` package are all within the
`service` subdirectory located in the root directory of the the GEOPM
repository.  Please refer to the `service/README.rst` file for further
documentation about the GEOPM Service.  Additionally a comprehensive
overview of the GEOPM service is posted here:

https://geopm.github.io/geopmdpy/


GEOPM HPC Runtime
-----------------

The `geopm` package provides many built-in features.  An advanced use
case is dynamically coordinating hardware settings across all compute
nodes used by an distributed HPC application in response to the
application's behavior and resource manager requests.  The dynamic
coordination is implemented as a hierarchical control system for
scalable communication and decentralized control. The hierarchical
control system can optimize for various objective functions including
maximizing global application performance within a power bound or
minimizing energy consumption with marginal degradation of application
performance.  The root of the control hierarchy tree can communicate
with the system resource manager to extend the hierarchy above the
individual MPI application and enable the management of system power
resources for multiple MPI jobs and multiple users by the system
resource manager.

More documentation on the GEOPM HPC Runtime is posted with our web
documentation here:

Guide for Contributors
----------------------

We appreciate all feedback on our project.  Please see our
contributing guide for how some guidelines on how to participate.
This guide is located in the root of the GEOPM repository in a file
called `CONTRIBUTING.rst`.  This guide can also be viewed here:

https://geopm.github.io/geopmdpy/contrib.html


Guide for GEOPM Developers
--------------------------

GEOPM is an open development project and we use Github to plan, review
and test our work.  The proccess we follow is documented here:

https://geopm.github.io/geopmdpy/devel.html

this web page provides a guide for developers wishing to modify source
code anywhere in the GEOPM repository for both the `geopm-service` and
the `geopm` packages.


Status
------

This software is production quality as of version 1.0.  We will be
enforcing [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) for all releases
following version 1.0.  We are very interested in feedback from the
community.  Refer to the ChangeLog a high level history of changes in
each release.  See
[github issues page](https://github.com/geopm/geopm/issues)
for information about ongoing work and please provide feedback by
opening issues.  Test coverage by unit tests is lacking for some files
and will continue to be improved.  The line coverage results from gcov
as reported by gcovr for the latest release can be found
[here](http://geopm.github.io/coverage/index.html)

Some new features of GEOPM are still under development, and their
interfaces may change before they are included in official releases.
To enable these features in the GEOPM install location, configure
GEOPM with the `--enable-beta` configure flag.  The features currently
considered unfinalized are the endpoint interface, the `geopmendpoint`
application, and the `geopmplotter` application.
