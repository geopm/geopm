SUMMARY
-------
The Global Extensible Open Power Manager (GEOPM) is a framework for
exploring power and energy optimizations targeting high performance
computing.

With GEOPM you can:

- Interact with hardware settings using a platform-agnostic interface
- Profile applications to study their power and energy behavior
- Automatically detect MPI and OpenMP phases in an application
- Optimize MPI applications to improve energy efficiency or reduce the
  effects of work imbalance, system jitter, and manufacturing variation
  through built-in control algorithms
- Develop your own runtime control algorithms through the extensible
  plugin architecture


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The GEOPM package provides many built-in features.  A
simple use case is reading hardware counters and setting hardware
controls with platform independant syntax using a command line tool on
a particular compute node.  An advanced use case is dynamically
coordinating hardware settings across all compute nodes used by an
application in response to the application's behavior and requests
from the resource manager.  The dynamic coordination is implemented as
a hierarchical control system for scalable communication and
decentralized control. The hierarchical control system can optimize
for various objective functions including maximizing global
application performance within a power bound or minimizing energy
consumption with marginal degradation of application performance.  The
root of the control hierarchy tree can communicate with the system
resource manager to extend the hierarchy above the individual MPI
application and enable the management of system power resources for
multiple MPI jobs and multiple users by the system resource manager.

The GEOPM package provides two libraries: libgeopm for use with MPI
applications, and libgeopmpolicy for use with applications that do not
link to MPI.  There are several command line tools included in GEOPM
which have dedicated manual pages.  The geopmlaunch(1) command line
tool is used to launch an MPI application while enabling the GEOPM
runtime to create a GEOPM Controller thread on each compute node.  The
Controller loads plugins and executes the Agent algorithm to control
the compute application.  The geopmlaunch(1) command is part of the
geopmpy python package that is included in the GEOPM installation.
See the GEOPM overview man page for further documentation and links:
[geopm(7)](https://geopm.github.io/man/geopm.7.html).

The GEOPM runtime is extended through three plugin classes: Agent,
IOGroup, and Comm.  New implementations of these classes can be
dynamically loaded at runtime by the GEOPM Controller.  The Agent
class defines which data are collected, how control decisions are
made, and what messages are communicated between Agents in the tree
hierarchy.  The reading of data and writing of controls from within a
compute node is abstracted from the Agent through the PlatformIO
interface.  This interface provides access to the IOGroup
implementations that provide a variety of signals and controls.
IOGroup plugins can be developed independently of the Agents to extend
the read and write capabilities provided by GEOPM.  The PlatformIO
abstraction enables Agent implementations to be ported to different
hardware platforms without modification.  Messaging between Agents
running on different compute nodes is encapsulated in the Comm class.
New implementations of the Comm class make it possible to port
inter-node communication used by the GEOPM runtime to different
underlying communication protocols and hardware without modifying the
Agent implementations.

The libgeopm library can be called directly or indirectly within MPI
applications to enable application feedback for informing the control
decisions.  The indirect calls are facilitated by GEOPM's integration
with MPI and OpenMP through their profiling decorators, and the direct
calls are made through the geopm_prof_c(3) or geopm_fortran(3)
interfaces.  Marking up a compute application with profiling
information through these interfaces can enable better integration of
the GEOPM runtime with the compute application and more precise
control.

TRAVIS CI
---------
The GEOPM public GitHub project has been integrated with Travis
continuous integration.

http://travis-ci.org/geopm/geopm

All pull requests will be built and tested automatically by Travis.

INSTALL
-------
The OpenHPC project provides the most robust way to install GEOPM.

[OpenHPC](https://openhpc.community/)

The GEOPM project was first packaged with OpenHPC version 1.3.6.  The
OpenHPC install guide contains documentation on how to install GEOPM
and its dependencies and can be found on the OpenHPC download page.

[OpenHPC Downloads](https://openhpc.community/downloads/)

The OpenHPC packages are distributed from the OpenHPC OBS build server.

[yum and zypper repositories](http://build.openhpc.community/OpenHPC:/1.3/updates/)

The OpenHPC project packages all of the dependencies required by GEOPM
that are not part of a standard Linux distribution.  This includes the
msr-safe kernel driver and MSR save/restore functionality built into
the Slurm resource manager to enable robust reset of hardware controls
when returning compute nodes to the general pool available to other
users.

PYTHON INSTALL
--------------
The GEOPM python tools are packaged in the RPMs described above, but
the latest release is also available from PyPI as the `geopmpy`
package.  For example, to install the geopmpy package into your home
directory, run the following command:

    python -m pip install --user geopmpy

You may wish to install the latest development version of GEOPM as
many of the features arriving in GEOPM v2.0 are not yet available from
PyPI.  To install the latest development version of the `geopmpy`
package directly from GitHub, run the following command:

    python -m pip install --user "git+https://github.com/geopm/geopm.git@dev#egg=geopmpy&subdirectory=scripts"

Note these commands only install the GEOPM Python tools and do not
install the binaries required by the GEOPM runtime.  Without these binary files
*only* the following modules will load successfully:

    geopmpy.io
    geopmpy.launcher
    geopmpy.plotter
    geopmpy.update_report

All other modules rely on the output of the GEOPM build (namely
libgeopmpolicy.so) being present and available in LD_LIBRARY_PATH or
similar.

### Anaconda Usage
To create an Anaconda environment that contains the `geopmpy` package,
run the following commands:

    conda init
    conda activate # base env
    conda create --name geopm
    conda activate --stack geopm
    conda install git pip # To ensure usage of the env's pip and not system pip

    python -m pip install "git+https://github.com/geopm/geopm.git@dev#egg=geopmpy&subdirectory=scripts"

BUILD REQUIREMENTS
------------------
In order to build the GEOPM package from source, the below
requirements must be met.  The user can opt out of the features
enabled by any of these requirements by providing the appropriate
disable flag to the configure command line.

The GEOPM package requires a compiler that supports the MPI 2.2 and
C++11 standards.  These requirements can be met by using GCC version
4.7 or greater and installing the openmpi-devel package version 1.7 or
greater on RHEL and SLES Linux, and libopenmpi-dev on Ubuntu.
Documentation creation including man pages further requires the
rubygems and ruby-devel package on RHEL and SLES, or ruby and ruby-dev on
Ubuntu.

RHEL:

    yum install openmpi-devel elfutils-libelf-devel ruby-devel rubygems

SUSE:

    zypper install openmpi-devel elfutils-libelf-devel ruby-devel rubygems

UBUNTU (as of 18.04.3 LTS):

    apt install libtool automake libopenmpi-dev build-essential gfortran \
        libelf-dev ruby ruby-dev python libsqlite3-dev

Requirements that can be avoided by removing features with configure
option:

   - MPI compiler: --disable-mpi
   - A Fortran compiler:  --disable-fortran
   - The elfutils library: --disable-ompt

Alternatively these can be installed from source, and an alternate MPI
implementation to OpenMPI can be selected (e.g. the Intel distribution
of MPI).  See

    ./configure --help

for details on how to use non-standard install locations for build
requirements through the

    ./configure --with-<feature>

options.


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
------------------
The source code can be rebuilt from the source RPMs available from
OpenHPC.  To build from the git repository follow the instructions
below.

If building with the Intel toolchain the following environment variables
must be set prior to running configure:

    export CC=icc
    export CXX=icpc
    export FC=ifort
    export F77=ifort
    export MPICC=mpiicc
    export MPICXX=mpiicpc
    export MPIFC=mpiifort
    export MPIF77=mpiifort

To build all targets and install it in a "build/geopm" subdirectory of your
home directory run the following commands:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --prefix=$HOME/build/geopm
    make
    make install

An RPM can be created on a RHEL or SUSE system with the

    make rpm

target.  Note that the --with-mpi-bin option may be required to inform
configure about the location of the MPI compiler wrappers.  The following
command may be sufficient to determine the location:

    dirname $(find /usr -name mpicc)

To build in an environment without support for OpenMP (i.e. clang on Mac OS X)
use the

    ./configure --disable-openmp

option.  The

    ./configure --disable-mpi

option can be used to build only targets which do not require MPI.  By default
MPI targets are built.


RUN REQUIREMENTS
----------------
We are targeting SLES12 and RHEL7 distributions for functional runtime
support.  There is a single runtime requirement that can be obtained
from these distributions for the OpenMPI implementation of MPI.  To install,
follow the instructions below for your Linux distribution.

RHEL:

    yum install openmpi

SUSE:

    zypper install openmpi

Alternatively the MPI requirement can be met by using OpenHPC
packages.

### BIOS Configuration
If power governing or power balancing is the intended use case
for GEOPM deployment then there is an additional dependency on
the BIOS being configured to support RAPL control. To check for
BIOS support, execute the following on a compute node:
    ./tutorial/admin/00_test_prereqs.sh

If the script output contains:
    WARNING: The lock bit for the PKG_POWER_LIMIT MSR is set.  The power_balancer
             and power_governor agents will not function properly until this is cleared.

Please enable RAPL in your BIOS and if such an option doesn't exist please
contact your BIOS vendor to obtain a RAPL supported BIOS.

For additional information, please contact the GEOPM team.

### USER ENVIRONMENT
The libraries, binaries and python tools will not be installed into
the standard system paths if GEOPM is built from source and configured
with the `--prefix` option.  In this case, it is required that the
user augment their environment to specify the installed location.  If
the configure option is specified as above:

    GEOPM_PREFIX=$HOME/build/geopm
    ./configure --prefix=$GEOPM_PREFIX

then the following modifications to the user's environment should be
made prior to running any GEOPM tools:

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$GEOPM_PREFIX/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export PATH=$GEOPM_PREFIX/bin:$PATH
    export PYTHONPATH=$(ls -d $GEOPM_PREFIX/lib/python*/site-packages | tail -n1):$PYTHONPATH

Use a PYTHONPATH that points to the site-packages created by the geopm build.
The version created is for whichever version of python 3 was used in the
configure step.  If a different version of python is desired, override the
default with the --with-python option in the configure script.

### SYSTEMD CONFIGURATION
In order for GEOPM to properly use shared memory to communicate
between the Controller and the application, it may be necessary to
alter the configuration for systemd.  The default behavior of systemd
is to clean-up all inter-process communication for non-system users.
This causes issues with GEOPM's initialization routines for shared
memory.  This can be disabled by ensuring that `RemoveIPC=no` is set
in `/etc/systemd/logind.conf`.  Most Linux distributions change the
default setting to disable this behavior.  More information can be
found [here](https://superuser.com/a/1179962).

### MSR DRIVER
The msr-safe kernel driver must be loaded at runtime to support
user-level read and write of the model specific registers (MSRs)
configured by the allowed list.  The msr-safe kernel driver is
distributed with OpenHPC and can be installed using the RPMs
distributed there (see INSTALL section above).

The source code for the driver can be found here at the link below.

[msr-safe repo](https://github.com/scalability-llnl/msr-safe)

Alternately, you can run GEOPM as root with the standard msr driver loaded:

    modprobe msr

### LINUX POWER MANAGEMENT
Note that other Linux mechanisms for power management can interfere
with GEOPM, and these must be disabled.  We suggest disabling the
intel_pstate kernel driver by modifying the kernel command line
through grub2 or the boot loader on your system by adding:

    "intel_pstate=disable"

The cpufreq driver will be enabled when the intel_pstate driver is
disabled.  The cpufreq driver has several modes controlled by the
scaling_governor sysfs entry.  When the performance mode is selected,
the driver will not interfere with GEOPM.  For SLURM based systems the
[GEOPM launch wrappers](#geopm-mpi-launch-wrapper) will attempt to set
the scaling governor to "performance".  This alleviates the need to
manually set the governor.  Older versions of SLURM require the
desired governors to be explicitly listed in /etc/slurm.conf.  In
particular, SLURM 15.x requires the following option:

    CpuFreqGovernors=OnDemand,Performance

More information on the slurm.conf file can be found
[here](https://slurm.schedmd.com/slurm.conf.html).
Non-SLURM systems must still set the scaling governor through some
other mechanism to ensure proper GEOPM behavior.  The following
command will set the governor to performance:

    echo performance | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

See kernel documentation
[here](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/cpu-freq/governors.txt)
for more information.

### GEOPM APPLICATION LAUNCH WRAPPER
The GEOPM package installs the command, "geopmlaunch".  This is a
wrapper for the MPI launch commands like "srun", "aprun", and
"mpiexec" where the wrapper script enables the GEOPM runtime.  The
"geopmlaunch" command supports exactly the same command line interface
as the underlying launch command, but the wrapper extends the
interface with GEOPM specific options.  The "geopmlaunch" application
launches the primary compute application and the GEOPM control thread
on each compute node and manages the CPU affinity requirements for all
processes.  The wrapper is documented in the geopmlaunch(1) man page.

There are several underlying MPI application launchers that
"geopmlaunch" wrapper supports.  See the geopmlaunch(1) man page for
information on available launchers and how to select them.  If the
launch mechanism for your system is not supported, then affinity
requirements must be enforced by the user and all options to the GEOPM
runtime must be passed through environment variables.  Please consult
the geopm(7) man page for documentation of the environment variables
used by the GEOPM runtime that are otherwise controlled by the wrapper
script.

### CPU AFFINITY REQUIREMENTS
The GEOPM runtime requires that each MPI process of the application
under control is affinitized to distinct CPUs.  This is a strict
requirement for the runtime and must be enforced by the MPI launch
command.  When using the geopmlaunch wrapper described in the previous
section, these affinity requirements are handled by geopmlaunch unless
the --geopm-affinity-disable command line option is provided (see
geopmlaunch(1)).

While the GEOPM control thread connects to the application it will
automatically affinitize itself to the highest indexed core not used
by the application if the application is not affinitized to a CPU on
every core.  In the case were the application is utilizing all cores
of the system, the GEOPM control thread will be pinned to the highest
logical CPU.

There are many ways to launch an MPI application, and there is no
single uniform way of enforcing MPI rank CPU affinities across
different job launch mechanisms.  Additionally, OpenMP runtimes, which
are associated with the compiler choice, have different mechanisms for
affinitizing OpenMP threads within CPUs available to each MPI process.
To complicate things further the GEOPM control thread can be launched
as an application thread or a process that may be part of the primary
MPI application or a completely separate MPI application.  For these
reasons it is difficult to document how to correctly affinitize
processes in all configurations.  Please refer to your site
documentation about CPU affinity for the best solution on the system
you are using and consider extending the geopmlaunch wrapper to
support your system configuration (please see the CONTRIBUTING.md file
for information about how to share these implementation with the
community).

TESTING
-------
From within the source code directory, unit tests can be executed with
the "make check" target.  The unit tests can be built without executing
them with the "make checkprogs" target.  A typical parallel build and
test cyle is executed with the following commands:

    make -j
    make checkprogs -j
    make check

The unit tests can be executed on any development system, including
VMs and containers, that meets the BUILD REQUIREMENTS section above.

The integration tests are located in the "integration/test" directory.
These tests require a system meeting all of the requirements discussed
in the RUN REQUIREMENTS section above.  The following script can be used
to compile the GEOPM source, install into a specified location and execute
the integration scripts in a work directory.

    ##### USER SPECIFIC #####
    # Set the location of the GEOPM source tree
    export GEOPM_SOURCE=${HOME}/Git/geopm
    # Set the install prefix for the geopm build
    export GEOPM_INSTALL=${HOME}/build/geopm
    # Set a place to locate the output of the tests
    export GEOPM_WORKDIR=${HOME}/geopm_test
    #####   ALL USERS   #####
    # Script defines bash functions to build and install GEOPM
    source $GEOPM_SOURCE/integration/apps/build_func.sh
    # Execute out-of-place build and install using build function
    install_geopm
    # Set up run environment to use installed GEOPM
    source $GEOPM_SOURCE/integration/config/run_env.sh
    # Create a directory for output
    mkdir -p $GEOPM_WORKDIR
    cd $GEOPM_WORKDIR
    # Run the integration tests
    python3 $GEOPM_SOURCE/integration/test

These integration tests are based on pyunit and leverage the geopmpy
python package to validate the runtime.  Please report failures of
these tests as issues.

RESOURCE MANAGER INTEGRATION
----------------------------
The GEOPM package can be integrated with a compute cluster resource
manager by modifying the resource manager daemon running on the
cluster compute nodes.  An example of integration with the SLURM
resource manager via a SPANK plugin can be found here:

https://github.com/geopm/geopm-slurm

and the implementation reflects what is documented below.

Integration is achieved by modifying the daemon to make two
libgeopmpolicy.so function calls prior to releasing resources to the
user (prologue), and one call after the resources have been reclaimed
from the user (epilogue).  In the prologue, the resource manager
compute node daemon calls:

    geopm_pio_save_control()

which records into memory the value of all controls that can be
written through GEOPM (see geopm_pio_c(3)).  The second call made in
the prologue is:

    geopm_agent_enforce_policy()

and this call (see geopm_agent_c(3)) enforces the configured policy
such as a power cap or a limit on CPU frequency by a one time
adjustment of hardware settings.  In the epilogue, the resource
manager calls:

    geopm_pio_restore_control()

which will set all GEOPM platform controls back to the values read in
the prologue.

The configuration of the policy enforced in the prologue is controlled
by the two files:

    /etc/geopm/environment-default.json
    /etc/geopm/environment-override.json

which are JSON objects mapping GEOPM environment variable strings to
string values.  The default configuration file controls values used
when a GEOPM variable is not set in the calling environment.  The
override configuration file enforces values for GEOPM variables
regardless of what is specified in the calling environment.  The list
of all GEOPM environment variables can be found in the geopm(7) man
page.  The two GEOPM environment variables used by
geopm_agent_enforce_policy() are "GEOPM_AGENT" and "GEOPM_POLICY".
Note that it is expected that /etc is mounted on a node-local file
system, so the geopm configuration files are typically part of the
compute node boot image.  Also note that the "GEOPM_POLICY" value
specifies a path to another JSON file which may be located on a
shared file system, and this second file controls the values enforced
(e.g. power cap value in Watts, or CPU frequency value in Hz).

When configuring a cluster to use GEOPM as the site-wide power
management solution, it is expected that one agent algorithm with one
policy will be applied to all compute nodes within a queue partition.
The system administrator selects the agent based on the site
requirements.  If the site requires that the average CPU power draw
per compute node remains under a cap across the system, then they
would choose the power_balancer agent (see
geopm_agent_power_balancer(7)).  If saving as much energy as possible
with a limited impact on performance is the site requirement, then the
energy_efficient agent would be selected (see
geopm_agent_energy_efficient(7)).  If the site would like to restrict
applications to run below a particular CPU frequency unless they are
executing a high priority optimized subroutine that has been granted
permission by the site administration to run at an elevated CPU
frequency, they would choose the frequency_map agent (see
geopm_agent_frequency_map(7)).  There is also the option for a site
specific custom agent plugin to be deployed.  In all of these use
cases, calling geopm_agent_enforce_policy() prior to releasing compute
node resources to the end user will enforce static limits to power or
CPU frequency, and these will impact all user applications.  In order
to leverage the dynamic runtime features of GEOPM, the user must
opt-in by launching their MPI application with the geopmlaunch(1)
command line tool.

The following example shows how a system administrator would configure
a system to use the power_balancer agent.  This use case will enforce
a static power limit for applications which do not use geopmlaunch(),
and will optimize power limits to balance performance when
geopmlaunch() is used.  First, the system administrator creates the
following JSON object in the boot image of the compute node in the
path "/etc/geopm/environment-override.json":

    {"GEOPM_AGENT": "power_balancer",
     "GEOPM_POLICY": "/shared_fs/config/geopm_power_balancer.json"}

Note that the "POWER_PACKAGE_LIMIT_TOTAL" value controlling the limit
is specified in a secondary JSON file "geopm_power_balancer.json" that
may be located on a shared file system and can be created with the
geopmagent(1) command line tool.  Locating the policy file on the
shared file system enables the limit to be modified without changing
the compute node boot image.  Changing the policy value will impact
all subsequently launched GEOPM processes, but it will not change the
behavior of already running GEOPM control processes.
