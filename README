Summary
-------

The Global Extensible Open Power Manager (GEOPM) is a collaborative
framework for exploring power and energy optimizations on
heterogeneous platforms. GEOPM is open-source (BSD licensed) and
developed to enable efficient power management and performance
optimizations. With this powerful tool, users are able to monitor
their system's energy and power consumption, and safely optimize
system hardware settings to achieve energy efficiency and/or
performance objectives.

With GEOPM you can:

- Interact with hardware settings and sensors using a
  platform-agnostic interface
- Restore changes to hardware settings when configuring process
  terminates
- Profile applications to study their power and energy behavior
- Automatically detect MPI and OpenMP phases in an application
- Optimize applications to improve energy efficiency or reduce the
  effects of work imbalance, system jitter, and manufacturing variation
  through built-in control algorithms
- Develop your own runtime control algorithms through the extensible
  plugin architecture


Repository Organization
-----------------------

The GEOPM repository supports two software packages: the
`geopm-service` package and the `geopm` package.  The `geopm-service`
package provides a Linux systemd service.  The `geopm` package
provides a runtime for distributed HPC applications.

- A build of the `geopm-service` package is required to build and run
  the `geopm` HPC runtime

- All `geopm-service` package features may be used independently of
  the features provided by the `geopm` package

- All run and build requirements of the `geopm-service` package are
  provided by commonly used Linux distributions

- The run and build requirements of the `geopm` package include
  several additional HPC specific dependencies


GEOPM Service
-------------

The files supporting the `geopm-service` package are all within the
`service` subdirectory located in the root directory of the the GEOPM
repository.  Please refer to the `service/README.rst` file for further
documentation about the GEOPM Service.  Additionally a comprehensive
overview of the GEOPM service is posted here:

https://geopm.github.io/service.html


GEOPM Runtime
-------------

The GEOPM Service provides a foundation for manipulating hardware
settings to optimize an objective defined by an unprivileged user.
The GEOPM Runtime is a software platform built on top of the GEOPM
Service that enables users to select a runtime algorithm and policy to
meet energy efficiency or performance objectives.  More documentation
on the GEOPM Runtime is posted with our web documentation here:

https://geopm.github.io/runtime.html


Guide for Contributors
----------------------

We appreciate all feedback on our project.  Please see our
contributing guide for how some guidelines on how to participate.
This guide is located in the root of the GEOPM repository in a file
called `CONTRIBUTING.rst`.  This guide can also be viewed here:

https://geopm.github.io/contrib.html


Guide for GEOPM Developers
--------------------------

GEOPM is an open development project and we use Github to plan, review
and test our work.  The process we follow is documented here:

https://geopm.github.io/devel.html

this web page provides a guide for developers wishing to modify source
code anywhere in the GEOPM repository for both the `geopm-service` and
the `geopm` packages.


Status
------

GEOPM version 3.0 enables the GEOPM Runtime to be used with any
application.  It shifts responsibility for managing inter-process
communication between the application and the GEOPM controller to the
GEOPM Service.  The start up of the GEOPM runtime is done by the
libgeopm library initialization rather than through interposition on
MPI initialization functions.

GEOPM version 2.0 provides a number of important changes since the
previous tagged release v1.1.0.  Some of the most significant new
features are the GEOPM Service, support for Intel and NVIDIA GPUs, and
improved consistency of signal and control names provided by
PlatformIO.  A wide range of other improvements have also been made,
including a higher performance profiling interface to support highly
parallel applications, and support for the ``isst_interface`` driver.

This version of GEOPM is experimental and should not be used as a
production tool.

### New Features

- Runtime support for non-MPI applications
  + Feature issue https://github.com/geopm/geopm/issues/2875
  + Pull request https://github.com/geopm/geopm/pull/2836
  + Status: Stable, merged to to the `dev` branch
- Runtime support for non-MPI node-local controller
  + Implemented as part of https://github.com/geopm/geopm/pull/2836
  + Status: Stable, merged to to the `dev` branch
- Option to use gRPC in place of DBus communication
  + Feature issue https://github.com/geopm/geopm/issues/2775
  + Pull request https://github.com/geopm/geopm/pull/2779
  + Status: Merged into cloud branch.  Requires python grpcio version
    1.47.5 or 1.25.0.  All other recent releases have bugs that impact
    the python grpc server.  Python grpcio version 1.30.2 is now
    shipping with Ubuntu 20.04 and Tumbleweed.  This version hangs on
    server creation.  The Docker containers use pip to upgrade to
    1.47.5 in the server images.
- Rust front-end proxy server for gRPC API
  + Implemented as part of https://github.com/geopm/geopm/pull/2779
  + Status: See above, gRPC integration tests are failing, but not root caused
- Support for liburing for asynchronous kernel IO
  + Feature issue https://github.com/geopm/geopm/issues/2781
  + Pull request https://github.com/geopm/geopm/pull/2782
  + Status: Considered stable, but not merged into dev or cloud branch currently
- Kubernetes examples for using the service and the runtime
  + Topic does not currently have supporting Github issues or pull requests
  + The cloud branch contains [a service example](service/README.rst#kubernetes-support)
    and [a runtime example](k8/k8-monitor.yaml)
- Docker files for creating service and client containers
  + Topic does not currently have supporting Github issues or pull requests
  + The cloud branch provides [a GEOPM Service Dockerfile](service/Dockerfile)
    and several examples in the [k8](k8) directory for client and service
    docker containers.
- Packaging for Ubuntu
  + The cloud branch provides debian packaging for the GEOPM Service and the
    GEOPM Runtime.
  + Status: Stable, merged to to the `dev` branch
- Improvements in platform topology consistency
  + Issue https://github.com/geopm/geopm/issues/2832
  + Pull request https://github.com/geopm/geopm/pull/2845
  + Status: Stable, merged to to the `dev` branch
- User controlled loop period
  + Feature issue https://github.com/geopm/geopm/issues/1065
  + Pull request https://github.com/geopm/geopm/pull/2867
  + Status: Stable, merged to to the `dev` branch

Some new features of GEOPM are still under development, and their
interfaces may change before they are included in official releases.
To enable these features in the GEOPM install location, configure
GEOPM with the `--enable-beta` configure flag.  The features currently
considered unfinalized are the endpoint interface, and the
`geopmendpoint` application.  The CPU-CA and GPU-CA agents are also
beta features.

The GEOPM developers are very interested in feedback from the
community.  See the [contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) to learn how
to provide feedback.
