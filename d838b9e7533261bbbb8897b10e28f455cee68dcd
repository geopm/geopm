Maybe we need another function to calculate this size, or change geopm_agent_policy_json to allocate the buffer itself (which would make it behave differently than all our other functions that return strings)",

      "message": "Another approach could be to try something like 1024 bytes, then keep doubling and retrying every time it fails with an invalid argument error code. Maybe limit it to 10 tries (arbitrarily chosen), though I expect most would stop on iteration 1 or 2. How does that sound?",
