GEOPM Environment Configuration
===============================

This directory contains a collection of `bash` scripts that may be
sourced to set up a user's environment.  These scripts may be sourced
within a user's shell in order to build GEOPM, or to run against a
locally installed version of GEOPM.

Please refer to the [README](../README.md) one directory up for
information about how to define environment variables relevant to these
scripts in your `.geopmrc` file.
