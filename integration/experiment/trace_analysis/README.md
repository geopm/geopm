The scripts in this folder are used to analyze a single GEOPM trace
file.  They can be used standalone by passing the path to the trace
file as the last argument on the command line, or by importing them
into other scripts.

A short summary of the available scripts is listed here.  Each script
contains a more detailed description of its use at the top of the
file.

- sample_rate.py: uses the timestamps of lines in the trace to
  determine the rate of sampling
