From https://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/:

	HPL is a software package that solves a (random) dense linear
	system in double precision (64 bits) arithmetic on distributed-memory
	computers. It can thus be regarded as a portable as well as freely
	available implementation of the High Performance Computing Linpack Benchmark.

Testing has been done with MKL 19.0.4.243 and mvapich2 2.3.1 (dynamically linked).
Requires that the intel/19.0.4.243 environment module is loaded.
