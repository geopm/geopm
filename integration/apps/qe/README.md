[Quantum Espresso](http://www.quantum-espresso.org/) is a suite of software
for performing calculations on electronic structures and for materials
modeling. 

The build process uses
[XCONFIGURE](https://xconfigure.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to configure Quantum
Espresso and its dependency, [ELPA](https://elpa.mpcdf.mpg.de/). Test inputs
are made available by some benchmarking data sets available
[on GitHub](https://github.com/electronic-structure/benchmarks).
