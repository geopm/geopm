      "message": "Part of the motivation for including the network time in the ignore time (for the Epoch) was because the power balancer performs much better when network time is treated like ignore time.  In some cases, it is required for the power balancer in order to demonstrate any savings.\n\nHas the power balancer been tested with this change to understand if performance has been impacted?",

      "message": "Ok, I see.  I can\u0027t remember just now why we had to make the change here as well as in the agent, but the fix for the Balancer back in Q1 had it in both spots.\n\nI suppose we can rerun some of the more recent experiments with this in dev to understand the impact a bit better.  While the integration test will make sure this patch has not broken the general behavior of the agents, if performance has been otherwise impacted we\u0027ll have to do a Governor/Balancer sweep and compare it to an older data set.",
