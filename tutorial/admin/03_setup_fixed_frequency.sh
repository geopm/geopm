# This script sets up GEOPM configuration files to cause all jobs
# to be started with a fixed processor frequency 300 MHz below the
# base (sticker) frequency.  It should be run on every compute node
# for which this configuration is desired.
#
# This script modifies system files and typically requires root
# because these files are not expected to be writeable by non-admin users.
