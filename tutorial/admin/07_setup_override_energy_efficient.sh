# This script sets up GEOPM configuration files to enforce a maximum
# CPU frequency of 2.6 GHz for jobs that do not use GEOPM, and force jobs
# that use GEOPM to use the energy efficient agent with a policy ranging
# between 1.2 GHz and 3.7 GHz.  This script should be run on every compute
# node for which this configuration is desired.
#
# This script modifies system files and typically requires root
# because these files are not expected to be writeable by non-admin users.
