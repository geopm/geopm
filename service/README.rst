Overview
--------

The GEOPM Service provides a user-level interface to read telemetry
and configure settings of heterogeneous hardware platforms. Linux
system administrators may manage permissions for user access to
telemetry and configuration at a fine granularity.

Clients use the GEOPM Service DBus interface to interact with the
service.  The GEOPM Service package provides access to the DBus
interfaces from the command line, or programatically with library
interfaces for C, C++ and Python.

The service supports many simultaneous client sessions that make
measurements, but only clients from within one Linux process session
are granted write permission to configure hardware control values at
any time.  When a client process session is granted write access it
will retain that permission until the Linux session process leader of
that client process terminates.  When the process session leader
terminates, all hardware settings that are managed by the GEOPM Service
are restored to the values they had prior to the first client write
request.  See `setsid(2) <https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setsid.2.html>`_
manual for more information about the Linux session leader process.

Architecture
------------

The architecture diagram shows the relationship between the IOGroups
and the GEOPM Service.  IOGroups are the C++ classes that abstract
hardware interfaces like the LevelZeroIOGroup for interfacing with
Intel hardware through the LevelZero library API, or the MSRIOGroup
for interacting with the Model Specific Register device driver.  These
IOGroups provide a plugin mechanism for extending GEOPM.

The PlatformIO interface is a container for all IOGroups, and is the
primary interface for users interacting with hardware through GEOPM.
The PlatformIO interface may be accessed through language bindings
with Python, C, and C++ as well as command line tools like `geopmread`
and `geopmwrite`.  The GEOPM DBus interface, `io.github.geopm`,
provides the secure gateway to privileged PlatformIO features.  The
administrator uses the `geopmaccess` command line tool to configure
the DBus interface to enable user level access to any subset of the
privileged PlatformIO features.


Status
------

The GEOPM systemd service is a new feature.  What exists currently is
a work in progress, and there are several outstanding issues that must
be resolved before the GEOPM Service is ready for release with GEOPM
version 2.0.  These
`issues <https://github.com/geopm/geopm/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Ageopm-service>`_
are tracked on github with the "geopm-service" tag.


Signals and Controls
--------------------

Each GEOPM signal and control has an associated name and a hardware
domain.  The name is a unique string identifier defined by the IOGroup
that provides the signal or control.  The hardware domain that
provides the interface is represented by one of the enumerations as
defined by PlatformTopo.  A detailed description of the signals and
controls available on a system can be discovered with the
``geopmaccess`` command line tool.  The description includes information
useful for end-users, and it also provides information for system
administrators that will help them understand what is enabled for an
end-user when access is granted to a signal or control.


Access Management
-----------------

Access to signals and controls through the GEOPM Service is configured
by the system administrator.  The administrator controls a default
access list that applies to all users of the system.  This list
accessible signals and controls for all users may be augmented so that
users who are members of particular Unix groups may have enhanced
access.  The default lists are stored in:

.. code-block::

   /etc/geopm-service/0.DEFAULT_ACCESS/allowed_signals
   /etc/geopm-service/0.DEFAULT_ACCESS/allowed_controls


Each Unix group name ``<GROUP>`` that has extended permissions can
maintain one or both of the files

.. code-block::

   /etc/geopm-service/<GROUP>/allowed_signals
   /etc/geopm-service/<GROUP>/allowed_controls


Any missing files are inferred to be empty lists, including the
default access files.  A signal or control will not be available to
non-root users through the GEOPM Service until a system administrator
enables access through these allow lists.  It is recommended that all
manipulation of these files should be done through the GEOPM Service
with the ``geopmaccess`` command line tool.

Some filtering may be applied to the raw signals provided by the
IOGroups before being exposed to the client session.  In particular,
all monotonic signals (e.g. hardware counters) are reported with
respect to the value they had when they were first read in the
session, which is reported as zero.

Opening a Session
-----------------

A client process opens a session with the GEOPM Service each time a
PlatformIO object is created with libgeopm or libgeopmpolicy while the
GEOPM systemd service is active.  This session is initially opened in
read-only mode.  Calls into the D-Bus APIs that modify control values:

.. code-block::

   io.github.geopm.PlatformWriteControl
   io.github.geopm.PlatformPushControl


convert the session into write mode.  Only one write mode session is
allowed at any time.  The request will fail if a client attempts to
begin a write session while another client has one open.

When a session is converted to write mode, all controls that the
service is configured to support are recorded to a save directory in:

.. code-block::

   /var/run/geopm-service/SAVE_FILES


When a write mode session ends, all of these saved controls are
restored to the value they had when the session was converted,
regardless of whether or not they were adjusted during the session
through the service.

The request to open a session is done in the ServiceIOGroup
constructor, and the request to close the session is made by the
ServiceIOGroup destructor.  Calls to the ServiceIOGroup's
``write_control()`` or ``push_control()`` methods will trigger the
conversion of the session to write mode.  Calls to these methods will
only occur when the ServiceIOGroup is the only loaded IOGroup that
provides the control requested by the user since all IOGroups are
loaded by the PlatformIO factory after the ServiceIOGroup.

Note that if any control adjustments are made during a session through
the GEOPM Service then every control supported by GEOPM will be
reverted when the session ends.  One consequence of this is that when
a control is exposed to a user only through the GEOPM Service, then
the geopmwrite command line tool will not be effective (the value will
be written, but reverted when the geopmwrite process ends).  The
geopmsession command line tool can be used to write any number of the
GEOPM supported controls and keep a session open for a specified
duration (or until the geopmsession process is killed).

In addition to saving the state of controls, the GEOPM Service will
also lock access to controls for any other client until the
controlling session ends.  When the controlling session ends the saved
state is used to restore the values for all controls supported by the
GEOPM Service to the values they had prior to enabling the client to
modify a control.  The controlling session may end by an explicit
D-Bus call by the client, or when the process that initiated the
client session ends.  The GEOPM Service will use the ``pidfd_open(2)``
mechanism for notification of the end of the client process if this is
supported by the Linux kernel, otherwise it will poll procfs for the
process ID.  The GEOPM Service provides an interface that enables a
privileged user to end any currently running write mode session, and
block any access to controls by other clients.  There is a
corresponding unlock interface that will enable write mode sessions to
begin again.

Batch Server
------------

The GEOPM Service provides the implementation for the ServiceIOGroup
which accesses this implementation through the DBus interface.  When a
user program calls ``read_signal()`` or ``write_control()`` on a
PlatformIO object provided by libgeopm or libgeopmpolicy and the only
IOGroup that provides the signal or control requested is the
ServiceIOGroup, then each request goes through the slow D-Bus
interface.  When a client process uses the ServiceIOGroup for batch
operations a separate batch server process is created through the D-Bus
interface.  The implementations for ``push_signal()`` and
``push_control()`` are used to configure the stack of signals and
controls that will be enabled by the batch server.  This batch server
interacts more directly with the client process to provide low latency
support for the ``read_batch()`` and ``write_batch()`` interfaces of the
ServiceIOGroup.

The batch server is configured to allow access to exactly the signals
and controls that were pushed onto the stack for the ServiceIOGroup
prior to the first ``read_batch()`` or ``write_batch()`` call.  Through
the D-Bus implementation, the GEOPM Service verifies that the client
user has appropriate permissions for the requested signals and
controls.  When the first call to ``read_batch()`` or ``write_batch()`` is
made to user's PlatformIO object, the geopmd process forks the batch
server process and no more updates can be made to the configured
requests.  The batch server uses inter-process shared memory and POSIX
signals to enable fast access to the configured stack of GEOPM signals
and controls.  In this documentation we will call always refer to
"POSIX signals" to differentiate from the GEOPM signal concept which
is unrelated to the POSIX signal as defined in the signal(7) man page.

To implement the ``read_batch()`` method, the ServiceIOGroup sends a
POSIX signal to notify the batch server that it would like the
configured GEOPM signals to be updated in shared memory.  The batch
server reads all GEOPM signals that are being supported by the
client's ServiceIOGroup using the batch server's instance of the
PlatformIO object.  GEOPM signals are copied into the shared memory
buffer and a SIGCONT POSIX signal is sent from the batch server to the
client process when the buffer is ready.  To implement the
``write_batch()`` method, the client process's ServiceIOGroup prepares
the shared memory buffer with all control settings that it is
supporting.  The client sends a SIGCONT POSIX signal to the batch
server to notify it to write the settings.  The batch server then
reads the clients settings from a shared memory buffer and writes the
values through the server process's PlatformIO instance.
