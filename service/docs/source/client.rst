Guide for Service Clients
=========================

The GEOPM Service facilitates the PlatformIO interfaces by providing
security and quality guaruantees.  Clients of the GEOPM service may
access the PlatformIO features through a variety of interfaces
including C, C++, Python and command line tools.  The administrator of
the system may manage client access rights through the ``geopmaccess``
command line tool.

A high level overview of the PlatformIO abstraction is described in
the :doc:`geopm_pio(7) <geopm_pio.7>` man page.  This page and the
pages linked within describe all signals and controls that are available
through this interface.  A client may read the signals or write the
controls described in the overview with the interfaces listed below.
