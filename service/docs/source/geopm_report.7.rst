geopm_report(7) -- geopm summary report file
============================================

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The GEOPM report is a YAML file containing summarized information
about runtimes, network usage, energy consumption, and other data
about an application's behavior on every compute node where it ran.
The report is broken into sections with totals for each compute node,
and further divided into sections detailing each application region
and epoch.  By default, the report will be saved into a file called
"geopm.report", but this name can be customized with the GEOPM_REPORT
environment variable; refer to the description for ``--geopm-report`` in
`geopmlaunch(1) <geopmlaunch.1.html>`_.

The application regions and epoch are defined by use of the
`geopm_prof_c(3) <geopm_prof_c.3.html>`_ interface to mark up the user application, or
through automatic inference of regions based on interposing on the MPI
or OpenMP interfaces (interposing on OpenMP requires that OMPT is
enabled at GEOPM compile time, and the ``--geopm-ompt-disable`` option
is not provided to ``geopmlaunch``\ ). Alternatively, epochs may be
inserted automatically when ``--geopm-record-filter`` is used, as
described in `geopmlaunch(1) <geopmlaunch.1.html>`_.

NOTES ON SAMPLING
-----------------

Most data in the report is derived from PlatformIO signals (described
in `geopm::PlatformIO(3) <GEOPM_CXX_MAN_PlatformIO.3.html>`_\ ) sampled at a rate determined by the
Agent::wait() implementation for the active agent (see
`geopm::Agent(3) <GEOPM_CXX_MAN_Agent.3.html>`_\ ).  If a sample is longer than the rate specified
by the agent, the subsequent sample may be shortened to correct the rate.
Every sample interval, all values of interest
to the report are read, and the delta values between the last sample
and current sample are calculated.  This delta is attributed to the
current region hash for the corresponding domain.  By default,
synchronous values in the report are aggregated to the board domain,
so deltas will be attributed to a region only when all active CPUs on
the compute node are in that region.  For example, synchronous time is
aggregated into the ``sync-runtime (s)`` field as the sum of all
delta(time) when all active cores on the node were in the same region.
User extensions through GEOPM_REPORT_SIGNALS may be aggregated to
smaller domains.  If any CPUs within the domain are in different
regions at the time of the sample, the delta value will be attributed
to the unmarked region.  Only active CPUs assigned to the application
are considered when determining the region to attribute values to.

Values that are the result of sampling (most fields except 'runtime'
and 'count') may include small contributions from adjacent regions,
especially if regions are very short.  The amount of slop depends on
the controller sample rate and the number of region entries.  Sampled
values should not be compared with the per-process average runtime
``runtime (s)``\ ; use ``sync-runtime (s)`` instead.

Refer to the EXAMPLES section below.

REPORT FORMAT
-------------


*
  ``Header Fields``\ :

  ``GEOPM Version``\ : The version of the GEOPM library and tools used

  .. code-block::

                  for the run.  Note that if building from source,
                  ./autogen.sh must be rerun to update the version
                  to the latest git SHA.


  ``Start Time``\ : The start time of the job recorded by the GEOPM

  .. code-block::

               controller.


  ``Profile``\ : The profile string, obtained from the GEOPM_PROFILE

  .. code-block::

            environment variable.


  ``Agent``\ : The name of the agent, obtained from the GEOPM_AGENT

  .. code-block::

          environment variable.


  ``Policy``\ : A JSON string containing the policy values as set in

  .. code-block::

           GEOPM_POLICY, or "DYNAMIC" if the policy was received
           through the endpoint.


* ``Per-host Region, Epoch, and Application Totals``\ :

Under the ``Hosts`` section of the report, each host in the job creates
a section with its hostname as the key.  Each host's section contains
``Application Totals``\ , the totals for each metric from the beginning to
the end of the job; ``Epoch Totals``\ , the totals from the first detected
epoch to the end of the job; and ``Regions``\ , the summarized data for
each region.

The fields in each of these sections are described below:

  ``name``\ : Name of the region.  For user-defined regions, this is the
          string passed to ``geopm_region()``\ ; for automatically
          detected OpenMP and MPI regions this is the function name.
          See `geopm_prof_c(3) <geopm_prof_c.3.html>`_ for more information.

  ``hash``\ : The CRC32 hash of the region name.  This value is used by
          agents to distinguish regions using the REGION_HASH signal
          and also appears in the trace.

  ``runtime (s)``\ : The average across all processes of the total runtime
                 spent in the region.  For epoch totals, this is the
                 time from the first detected epoch to the end of the
                 application.  For application totals, this is the
                 time from the start to the end of the application,
                 corresponding to the MPI_Init() and MPI_Finalize()
                 calls.  This runtime is more accurate than
                 sync-runtime because it uses exact entry and exit
                 timestamps rather than the sampled REGION_HASH.  It
                 should not be used for comparisons with sampled
                 values below; use ``sync-runtime`` for comparisons
                 instead.

  ``count``\ : The total number of times this region was entered and
           exited, averaged accross all processes.  Fractional counts
           are possible if some processes entered a region a different
           number of times.  For epoch totals, this is the total
           number of detected epochs, averaged across all processes.
           The count has no meaning for the unmarked region and
           application totals.

  ``sync-runtime (s)``\ : Total time for which the sampled region hash
                      matched this region on all CPUs on the compute
                      node.  For epoch and application totals, this
                      value is the same as ``runtime (s)``.  The
                      sync-runtime for the unmarked region represents
                      the total time for which the ranks on a compute
                      node were not in the same region (i.e. unaligned).
                      All subsequent default fields in the report are
                      sampled in the same way as the sync-runtime and
                      can be compared with it.

  ``package-energy (J)``\ : Total energy in joules consumed by all
                        processor packages (sockets).

  ``dram-energy (J)``\ : Total energy in joules consumed by all DRAM on
                     the board.

  ``power (W)``\ : Average power for the processor package, calculated as
               package-energy divided by sync-runtime.

  ``frequency (%)``\ : Achieved core frequency as a percentage of the
                   sticker (base) frequency for the processor.  This
                   frequency is calculated using the ratio of
                   CYCLES_THREAD to CYCLES_REFERENCE.

  ``frequency (Hz)``\ : Achieved core frequency for the processor in
                    hertz.  This frequency is calculated using the
                    ratio of CYCLES_THREAD to CYCLES_REFERENCE times
                    the sticker (base) frequency.

  ``time-hint-network (s)``\ : The portion of sync-runtime where the
                           region hint was GEOPM_REGION_HINT_NETWORK.
                           The region hint is determined by the hint
                           passed to ``geopm_region()`` for the most
                           nested region.

  ``time-hint-ignore (s)``\ : The portion of sync-runtime where the region
                          hint was GEOPM_REGION_HINT_IGNORE.  The
                          region hint is determined by the hint passed
                          to ``geopm_region()`` for the most nested
                          region.

  ``time-hint-compute (s)``\ : The portion of sync-runtime where the
                           region hint was GEOPM_REGION_HINT_COMPUTE.
                           The region hint is determined by the hint
                           passed to ``geopm_region()`` for the most
                           nested region.

  ``time-hint-memory (s)``\ : The portion of sync-runtime where the region
                          hint was GEOPM_REGION_HINT_MEMORY.  The
                          region hint is determined by the hint passed
                          to ``geopm_region()`` for the most nested
                          region.

  ``time-hint-io (s)``\ : The portion of sync-runtime where the region
                      hint was GEOPM_REGION_HINT_IO.  The region hint
                      is determined by the hint passed to
                      ``geopm_region()`` for the most nested region.

  ``time-hint-serial (s)``\ : The portion of sync-runtime where the region
                          hint was GEOPM_REGION_HINT_SERIAL.  The
                          region hint is determined by the hint passed
                          to ``geopm_region()`` for the most nested
                          region.

  ``time-hint-parallel (s)``\ : The portion of sync-runtime where the
                            region hint was
                            GEOPM_REGION_HINT_PARALLEL.  The region
                            hint is determined by the hint passed to
                            ``geopm_region()`` for the most nested
                            region.

  ``time-hint-unknown (s)``\ : The portion of sync-runtime where the
                           region hint was GEOPM_REGION_HINT_UNKNOWN.
                           The region hint is determined by the hint
                           passed to ``geopm_region()`` for the most
                           nested region.

  ``time-hint-unset (s)``\ : The portion of sync-runtime where the region
                         hint was GEOPM_REGION_HINT_UNSET.  The region
                         hint also becomes unset when exiting an
                         unnested region (i.e. when a CPU is in the
                         unmarked region).

  ``gpu-energy (J)``\: Total energy in joules consumed by all
                    accelerators.

  ``gpu-power (W)``\: Average power for the accelerators in watts.

  ``gpu-frequency (Hz)``\: Achieved frequency for the accelerators in
                        hertz.

* ``Report Extensions``\ :

The report can be extended by agents, or by through the
``--geopm-report-signals`` option to ``geopmlaunch`` which corresponds to
the ``GEOPM_REPORT_SIGNALS`` environment variable.  See the description
for ``--geopm-report-signals`` in `geopmlaunch(1) <geopmlaunch.1.html>`_ for more details.
Signals in the ``GEOPM_REPORT_SIGNALS`` list will be added to individual
regions, the epoch totals, and the application totals for each host.

Agents can add keys to the report header, host section, or individual
region sections using the ``report_header()``\ , ``report_host()`` or
``report_region()`` methods respectively.  See `geopm::Agent(3) <GEOPM_CXX_MAN_Agent.3.html>`_ for
more information about the report extensions available to agents.

EXAMPLES
--------

Suppose we have a system with 2 sockets per node and 2 CPUs per
package (socket); assume 1 CPU per core for simplicity
(i.e. hyperthreading is turned off if applicable).  The application
places one process (MPI rank) on each CPU, and each rank executes the
same application code, containing regions called "A" and "B".  The
processes are assigned to cores as follows:

.. code-block::

     socket 0     |      socket 1

  CPU 0  |  CPU 1  |  CPU 2  |  CPU 3
---------+---------+---------+----------
    1    |    2    |    3    |    4

The following is an example of the region enter/exit and epoch events
seen by the Controller.  This stream of events will be used to
calculate the average runtime and count over ranks for regions and
epoch, and the current region hash for sampling.

The following is an example of the regions being entered and exited on
each CPU.  The sample rate is 0.002 s; the region hash for the
REGION_HASH sample at larger domains is shown on the right side of the
table; "-" indicates the unmarked region.  Note that in a real report,
the entry and exit times used to calculate the "runtime" may not line
up exactly with the sample boundaries (e.g. 0.003 or 0.005), and
samples may not be exactly the same length throughout the run.

A subset of the report is shown below.  The "runtime" and "count"
fields are averaged across the 4 CPUs.  The user extensions for
"TIME@package" correspond to the sync runtime for each package.
