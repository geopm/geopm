geopmpy(7) -- global extensible open power manager python package
=================================================================

Description
-----------

An extension to the Global Extensible Open Power Manager (GEOPM), the
geopmpy package provides several command line tools and other
infrastructure modules for both setting up and launching a job
utilizing GEOPM and post-processing the profiling data that is output
from GEOPM.  Presently the following command line tools are provided:

geopmlaunch
^^^^^^^^^^^
This script will invoke the GEOPM launcher for either the ALPS or SLURM
resource managers.  See :doc:`geopmlaunch(1) <geopmlaunch.1>` for more information.

In addition, there is 1 infrastructure module provided:

io.py
^^^^^
This module provides tools for parsing and encapsulating report and trace data
into either simple structures or **Pandas** ``DataFrame``\ s.  It can be used to parse
any number of files, and houses structures that can be queried for said data.
This module also houses certain analysis functions in the ``Trace`` class for
extracting specific data.  See the in-file docstrings for more info.

Installation
------------

Source Builds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Building GEOPM with the build instructions posted on the GitHub site will put
the Python scripts in either the system path for Python, or in a subdirectory
of the ``"--prefix"`` path.  See the :ref:`geopmpy.7:Environment` section for more
information on how to set up this configuration.

Via PyPI
^^^^^^^^
The geopmpy package can be installed via pip from PyPI with:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo pip install geopmpy

OR for an individual user install (not system wide)

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --user geopmpy

Environment
-----------
A note on ``PYTHONPATH`` and ``PATH``:

If you are installing GEOPM into the system's default paths for Python, etc.
then there is nothing to be done here.  Otherwise, if you are using
``--prefix=<PREFIX_PATH>`` when you run configure then you must set your
``PYTHONPATH`` to the location of the built ``site-packages`` directory. For
example, the ``PYTHONPATH`` for a python 3.6 build may look like:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PYTHONPATH=<PREFIX_PATH>/lib/python3.6/site-packages:${PYTHONPATH}

You must also set your ``PATH`` variable to:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH=<PREFIX_PATH>/bin:${PATH}

It is recommended to do this in your login script (e.g. ``.bashrc``).

Troubleshooting
---------------

If you have an existing clone of the GEOPM GitHub repo and are experiencing
a ``pkg_resources.DistributionNotFound`` error when attempting to run the Python
scripts, please remove the ``VERSION`` file at the root of your repo and re-run
``autogen.sh``.

The version file will be removed if the ``dist-clean`` **Makefile** target is invoked.
This is also remedied by rerunning ``autogen.sh``.
