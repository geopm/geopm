geopmbench(1) -- synthetic benchmark application
================================================

Synopsis
--------

.. code-block:: bash

       geopmbench [CONFIG_FILE]

Description
-----------

The GEOPM model application is provided as an example application
containing several marked regions with different runtime characteristics.
It can be used as a synthetic benchmark to test the behavior of plugins to GEOPM,
or as an integration test of the installation. It is also used in the
tutorials. The optional configuration passed as ``CONFIG_FILE`` can be used to adjust the
number and type of regions, problem size of each region (referred to as ``big-o``),
and number of iterations to run the entire application. The ``big-o`` value for
each of the regions is designed such that a ``big-o`` of ``1.0`` will run on the order of one second,
and the runtime will scale linearly with ``big-o``. The correct base value for one second
of runtime varies between platforms, so the ``big-o`` should be tuned to achieve the
desired runtime on a platform. The regions can also be configured to run with imbalance
on different nodes.

Region names can be one of the following options:


* 
  *sleep*\ :
  Executes ``clock_nanosleep()`` for ``big-o`` seconds.

* 
  *spin*\ :
  Executes a spin loop for ``big-o`` seconds.

* 
  *dgemm*\ :
  Dense matrix-matrix multiply with floating point operations proportional to ``big-o``.

* 
  *stream*\ :
  Executes stream "triad" on a vector with length proportional to ``big-o``.

* 
  *all2all*\ :
  All processes send buffers to all other processes. The time of this operation is
  proportional to ``big-o``.

* 
  *nested*\ :
  Executes *spin*\ , *all2all*\ , and *spin* within a single region.

* 
  *ignore*\ :
  Sleeps for a number of seconds equal to the ``big-o``.

Of these regions, *dgemm* exhibits the most compute-intensive behavior and will be
sensitive to frequency, while *stream* is memory-intensive and is less sensitive
to CPU frequency. *all2all* represents a network-intensive region.

The JSON config file must follow this schema:

.. literalinclude:: ../../../json_schemas/geopmbench_config.schema.json
    :language: json

Examples
--------

Use :doc:`geopmlaunch(1) <geopmlaunch.1>` to launch ``geopmbench`` with a given configuration provided as
a command line argument:

.. code-block:: bash

   geopmlaunch srun -N 2 -n 32 -c 4 --geopm-ctl=process \
                                    --geopm-report=bench.report \
                                    -- geopmbench config.json


The config file is a JSON file containing the loop count and sequence of regions in each loop.

Example configuration JSON string:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "loop-count": 10,
     "region": [
       "sleep",
       "stream",
       "dgemm",
       "stream",
       "all2all"
     ],
     "big-o": [
       1.0,
       1.0,
       1.0,
       1.0,
       1.0
     ]
   }

The ``"loop-count"`` value is an integer that sets the
number of loops executed.  Each time through the loop
the regions listed in the ``"region"`` array are
executed.  The ``"big-o"`` array gives double precision
values for each region.

Example configuration JSON string with imbalance:

.. code-block:: json

   {
     "loop-count": 10,
     "region": [
       "sleep",
       "stream",
       "dgemm-imbalance",
       "stream",
       "all2all"
     ],
     "big-o": [
       1.0,
       1.0,
       1.0,
       1.0,
       1.0
     ],
     "hostname": [
       "compute-node-3",
       "compute-node-15"
     ],
     "imbalance": [
       0.05,
       0.15
     ]
   }

If ``"-imbalance"`` is appended to any region name in
the configuration file and the ``"hostname"`` and
``"imbalance"`` fields are provided then those
regions will have an injected delay on the hosts
listed.  In the above example a 5% delay on
``"my-compute-node-3"`` and a 15% delay on
``"my-compute-node-15"`` are injected when executing
the *dgemm* region.

If ``"-progress"`` is appended to any region name in the
configuration, then progress for the region will be
reported through the ``geopm_tprof_*()`` API.
