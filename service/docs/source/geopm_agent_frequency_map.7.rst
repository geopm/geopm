geopm_agent_frequency_map(7) -- agent for running regions at user selected frequencies
======================================================================================






DESCRIPTION
-----------

The frequency map agent adjusts CPU frequency in response to changes
in the application region being executed on each CPU.  The agent
policy provides a map from a GEOPM region hash to a CPU frequency; see
`geopm_hash(3) <geopm_hash.3.html>`_ for more information about the GEOPM region name
hash function.  When a CPU is executing a region with a hash provided
by the policy, the CPU will operate at the mapped frequency.  The
policy also provides a default CPU frequency which is applied to all
CPUs running the application while not executing a region described by
the policy map.

Applying any control algorithm that changes CPU frequency on short
intervals can result in undesirable interactions with the hardware
control algorithm that dynamically selects uncore frequency.  For this
reason, the frequency map agent policy provides an option to fix the
uncore frequency to a single value while executing the application.
If this option is not specified, the uncore frequency is not
controlled by the agent at all.

Note: this agent can be used to control the application CPUs and
optionally the uncore to run at fixed frequencies if no region
frequency map is provided.

AGENT NAME
----------

The agent described in this manual is selected in many geopm
interfaces with the ``"frequency_map"`` agent name.  This name can be
passed to `geopmlaunch(1) <geopmlaunch.1.html>`_ as the argument to the ``--geopm-agent``
option, or the ``GEOPM_AGENT`` environment variable can be set to this
name (see `geopm(7) <geopm.7.html>`_\ ).  This name can also be passed to the
`geopmagent(1) <geopmagent.1.html>`_ as the argument to the ``'-a'`` option.

POLICY PARAMETERS
-----------------

  ``FREQ_DEFAULT``\ :
      The operating frequency in units of *Hz* set by the
      agent on CPUs executing the application while the
      application is not within a policy-mapped region.
      The cores not associated with the application
      (including the one running the geopm controller)
      will run at the default frequency.  This policy
      parameter is required and must be specified with a
      CPU frequency that is allowed by the system.
      Failure to provide this parameter, setting it to an
      out of range value or specifying NAN will result in
      a runtime error.

  ``FREQ_UNCORE``\ :
      The operating frequency for the uncore clock in units
      of *Hz*.  If specified the uncore clock will operate
      the fixed frequency provided.  If the parameter is
      not specified, or the value provided is NAN, then the
      system default range of uncore frequency will be
      allowed.

  ``HASH_0``\ :
      The GEOPM hash of a region name with a mapped CPU
      frequency given by the ``FREQ_0`` policy parameter.  The
      region hash values for each application region are
      provided in the geopm report, and can be generated as
      described in `geopm_hash(3) <geopm_hash.3.html>`_.  In binary code, the
      policy values are stored the double precision
      representation of the 32-bit integer generated by the hash
      function.  When using the `geopmagent(1) <geopmagent.1.html>`_ interface to
      generate a policy file, the region name can be provided in
      the comma separated list for the ``-p`` option rather than
      the hash of that string. See `EXAMPLES <EXAMPLES_>`_ section below for
      details.

  ``FREQ_0``\ :
      The CPU frequency in units of *Hz* that will be set when a
      CPU is executing the region associated with the ``HASH_0``
      region hash.  When using the `geopmagent(1) <geopmagent.1.html>`_ command
      line interface to generate a policy file, the mapped
      frequency will always follow the region name or hash in
      the comma separated list for the ``-p`` option.

  ``HASH_1``\ :
      The next region hash in the map after ``HASH_0``.

  ``FREQ_1``\ :
      The next CPU frequency in the map after ``FREQ_0``.

  ...

  ``HASH_30``:
      There are at most 31 values in the map provided by the policy.

  ``FREQ_30``:
      The CPU frequency mapped by ``HASH_30``.



POLICY REQUIREMENTS
-------------------

The frequency map index values can be in the range of 0 to 30,
inclusive. The order of index values does not matter, and gaps in
index values are permitted. Multiple definitions of an index are not
permitted, and multiple mappings of a region are not permitted.  If a
CPU or uncore frequency specified in the policy is not allowed by the
system at runtime, an error will occur and an exception will be
raised.

REPORT EXTENSIONS
-----------------

The assigned frequency is added to each region's section of the report
if that region was explicitly assigned a frequency in the policy map.

CONTROL LOOP RATE
-----------------

The agent gates the control loop to sample the region hash and control
CPU frequency at 2 millisecond intervals.  If the uncore frequency is
specified in the policy, then it is set at agent start up time.

EXAMPLES
--------

Besides the default CPU frequency and uncore frequency parameters, the
policy consists of the map of per-region frequencies given as pairs of
region hash and CPU frequency values.  The recommended way to generate
a policy file for this agent is to use the `geopmagent(1) <geopmagent.1.html>`_ command
line tool.

To create a policy with a default frequency of *3 GHz*, an uncore
frequency of *2 GHz* with a map of ``"region_1"`` to *1.5 GHz* and ``"region_2"``
to *2.5 GHz* you can specify:

.. code-block::

   geopmagent -a frequency_map -p '3e9,2e9,region_1,1.5e9,region_2,2.5e9'


Alternatively you can specify the regions by their hashed values:

.. code-block::

   geopmagent -a frequency_map -p '3e9,2e9,0xee12ee15,1.5e9,0xfd421de1,2.5e9'


Although the `geopmagent(1) <geopmagent.1.html>`_ is the recommended tool for creating
the json policy string, there is one thing to note about creating the
json string without this tool.  Since json does not support hex
literals, the json must include the hashes in their decimal form. For
example, the above policy json is:

.. code-block:: json

   {"FREQ_DEFAULT": 3e9,
    "FREQ_UNCORE": 2e9,
    "HASH_0": 3994218005,
    "FREQ_0": 1.5e9,
    "HASH_1": 4248968673,
    "FREQ_1": 2.5e9}


The `geopmread(1) <geopmread.1.html>`_ command line tool can be useful for learning the
bounds of these system parameters.  The minimum, sticker, and
maximum CPU frequencies are queried as below:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ geopmread CPU_FREQUENCY_MIN board 0
   1000000000

   $ geopmread CPU_FREQUENCY_STICKER board 0
   2100000000

   $ geopmread CPU_FREQUENCY_MAX board 0
   3700000000


The minimum, and maximum uncore frequencies are queried as below:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ geopmread MSR::UNCORE_RATIO_LIMIT:MIN_RATIO board 0
   1200000000

   $ geopmread MSR::UNCORE_RATIO_LIMIT:MAX_RATIO board 0
   2400000000


The **geopmagent** and **geopmread** command line tools can be used together
to generate policies.  For example, to create a policy with the
default CPU frequency set to two steps below maximum and the uncore
frequency to the maximum the following commands can be used:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ freq_default=$(($(geopmread CPU_FREQUENCY_MAX board 0) - \
                     2 * $(geopmread CPU_FREQUENCY_STEP board 0)))
   $ freq_uncore=$(geopmread MSR::UNCORE_RATIO_LIMIT:MAX_RATIO board 0)
   $ geopmagent -a frequency_map -p$freq_default,$freq_uncore
     {"FREQ_DEFAULT": 3500000000, "FREQ_UNCORE": 2400000000}
