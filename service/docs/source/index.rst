Welcome to GEOPM
================


The Global Extensible Open Power Manager (GEOPM) is a framework for exploring
power and energy optimizations targeting heterogeneous platforms. The GEOPM
package provides many built-in features. A simple use case is reading hardware
counters and setting hardware controls with platform independent syntax using
a command line tool on a particular compute node. An advanced use case is
dynamically coordinating hardware settings across all compute nodes used by a
distributed application in response to the application's behavior and requests
from the resource manager.
