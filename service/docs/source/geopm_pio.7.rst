geopm_pio(7) -- GEOPM PlatformIO interface
==========================================

Description
-----------

The ``PlatformIO`` class provides a high-level interface for signals
(system monitors) and controls (system settings).  There are a large
number of built-in signals and controls.  These built-in signals and
controls include hardware metrics, hardware settings, and signals
derived from application behavior.  Application behavior is tracked by
GEOPM's integration with MPI and OpenMP and also by application use of
the :doc:`geopm_prof(3) <geopm_prof.3>` mark-up interface. In
addition to the built-in features, ``PlatformIO`` can be extended
through the :doc:`geopm::IOGroup(3) <GEOPM_CXX_MAN_IOGroup.3>` plugin
interface to provide arbitrary signals and controls.

A domain is a discrete component within a compute node where a signal
or control is applicable.  For more information about the
``geopm_domain_e`` enum and the hierarchical platform description see
:doc:`geopm_topo(3) <geopm_topo.3>`.  A
signal represents any measurement in SI units that can be sampled or
any unit-free integer that can be read.  A control represents a
request for a hardware domain to operate such that a related signal
measured from the hardware domain will track the request.  For
example, the user can set a ``CPU_POWER_LIMIT_CONTROL`` in units of
*watts* and the related signal, ``CPU_POWER``\ , will remain below
the limit.  Similarly the user can set a ``CPU_FREQUENCY_MAX_CONTROL`` in
*hertz* and the related signal, ``CPU_FREQUENCY_STATUS`` will show the
CPU operating at the value set.

See the :doc:`geopmread(1) <geopmread.1>` and :doc:`geopmwrite(1)
<geopmwrite.1>` tools for command-line interaction with the ``PlatformIO``
interface.

Aliasing Signals And Controls
-----------------------------

There are two classes of signals and control names: "low level" and
"high level".  All ``IOGroup``\ 's are expected to provide low level
signals and controls with names that are prefixed with the ``IOGroup``
name and two colons, e.g. the ``MSRIOGroup`` provides the
``MSR::PKG_ENERGY_STATUS:ENERGY`` signal.  If the signal or control may
be supported on more than one platform, the implementation should be
aliased to a high level name.  This high level name enables the signal
or control to be supported by more than one ``IOGroup``\ , and different
platforms will support the loading different sets of ``IOGroups``.  The
``MSRIOGroup`` aliases the above signal to the high level
``CPU_ENERGY`` signal which can be used on any platform to measure
the current CPU energy value.  Agents are encouraged to request
high level signals and controls to make the implementation more
portable.  The high level signals and controls supported by built-in
``IOGroup`` classes are listed below.  See :doc:`geopm::PluginFactory(3)
<GEOPM_CXX_MAN_PluginFactory.3>` section on :ref:`SEARCH AND LOAD ORDER
<GEOPM_CXX_MAN_PluginFactory.3:Plugin Search Path And Load Order>` for
information about how the ``GEOPM_PLUGIN_PATH`` environment variable is used to
select which ``IOGroup`` implementation is used in the case where more than one
provides the same high level signal or control.

Signal names that end in ``#`` (for example, raw MSR values) are 64-bit
integers encoded to be stored as doubles.  When accessing these
integer signals, the return value of ``read_signal()`` or ``sample()``
should not be used directly as a double precision number.  To
decode the 64-bit integer from the double use
``geopm_signal_to_field()`` described in :doc:`geopm_hash(3) <geopm_hash.3>`.  The
:doc:`geopm::MSRIOGroup(3) <GEOPM_CXX_MAN_MSRIOGroup.3>` also provides raw MSR field signals that are
encoded in this way.

    function inside of a user defined region, the hint will change from the
    hint associated with the user defined region to ``GEOPM_REGION_HINT_NETWORK``.
    If the user defined region was defined with ``GEOPM_REGION_HINT_NETWORK`` and
    there is an interval within the region when all ranks are within an MPI
    function, GEOPM will not attribute the time spent within the MPI function as
    MPI time in the report files.  It will be instead attributed to the time
    spent in the region as a whole.

Low Level Signals and Controls
------------------------------

The high level alias signals and controls defined in this man page may be
supported by one or more IOGroups.  These IOGroups also provide signals and
controls which extend the capabilities described in this page.  These signals
and controls are described as "low level signals and controls", and these have
names that are prefixed by the IOGroup name that provides it.  For example, the
``MSRIOGroup`` provides the ``MSR::PERF_CTL:FREQ`` low level control.  This is
the underlying implementation for the high level alias
``CPU_FREQUENCY_MAX_CONTROL`` on x86 platforms when HWP is disabled.  Some low
level signals and controls do not have high level aliases associated with them.
To learn about these low level signals and controls please consult the chapter
7 man page for each IOGroup as linked below.
