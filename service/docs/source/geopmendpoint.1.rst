geopmendpoint(1) -- command line tool for dynamic policy control
================================================================

Synopsis
--------

.. code-block:: bash

       geopmendpoint [-c | -d | -a | -p POLICY0, POLICY1, ...] ENDPOINT

Description
-----------

Command line interface to create, query, read, write, and destroy a
GEOPM runtime endpoint.

A GEOPM endpoint is a shared memory attach
point to connect a managing process (e.g. a resource manager or job
scheduler) to a GEOPM controller.  The endpoint supports writing of
*agent-specific* policies and the reading of *agent-specific* signals.
The agent signals and controls are described on the :doc:`geopmagent(1) <geopmagent.1>`
man page.  The ``ENDPOINT`` positional argument specifies the endpoint
name and is typically the name associated with the job or the job
identifier.  This string is arbitrary, but cannot contain the ``'/'`` or
``','`` characters.  This name distinguishes all endpoints running on any
given compute node (coherent shared memory).

If the ``geopmendpoint``
executable is run with no arguments then a list of all policy
endpoints available on the system is printed to standard output.

Options
-------
-c         Create an endpoint for an attaching agent.
-d         Destroy the endpoint and send a signal to any attached agent that no
           more policies will be written or samples read from the endpoint.
-a         Check if an agent has attached to the endpoint, and print the name
           of the agent if it has.  The return value will be non-zero if an
           agent has not yet attached to the endpoint.
-s         Read a sample from the attached agent, if any.  The output has one
           line per signal.  On each line is written the signal name and signal
           value separated by a colon.  The last line of the output represents
           the ``SAMPLE_AGE`` signal which is the elapsed time since the last
           update to the endpoint by the GEOPM runtime.  The signal names
           provided by an agent can be determined with the :doc:`geopmagent(1)
           <geopmagent.1>` command line tool.  The return value will be
           non-zero if an agent has not yet attached to the endpoint.
-p POLICY  Set policies for the attached agent.  The values to be set for each
           policy are given in a comma-separated list.  The order of these
           values corresponds to the ordering of the policy names by the
           :doc:`geopmagent(1) <geopmagent.1>` executable when the attached
           agent is specified.  The return value will be non-zero if an agent
           has not yet attached to the endpoint.

Examples
--------

List all endpoints on a system when none are open:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ geopmendpoint


Create two endpoints called ``"job-123"`` and ``"job-321"`` for agents to
attach:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ geopmendpoint -c job-123
   $ geopmendpoint
   job-123
   $ geopmendpoint -c job-321
   $ geopmendpoint
   job-123
   job-321


Check if agent has attached to endpoint ``"job-123"``, but no agent has
yet attached:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ geopmendpoint -a job-123
   Error: <geopm> No agent has attached to endpoint.


Check if agent has attached to endpoint ``"job-321"`` after a
``power_balancer`` agent has attached:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ geopmendpoint -a job-321
   Agent: power_balancer
   Nodes: compute-node-4,compute-node-5,compute-node-7,compute-node-8


Set policy at endpoint for ``power_balancer`` agent with 250 Watt per
node power budget:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ geopmendpoint -p 250 job-321


Sample from balancing agent with endpoint ``"job-321"``:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ geopmendpoint -s job-321
   POWER: 247.2
   IS_CONVERGED: 1
   EPOCH_RUNTIME: 90.5
   SAMPLE_AGE: 1.234E-4


Destroy endpoints ``"job-123"`` and ``"job-321"``:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ geopmendpoint -d job-321
   $ geopmendpoint
   job-123
   $ geopmendpoint -d job-123
   $ geopmendpoint
