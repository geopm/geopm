    Set Core Priority with SST
    --------------------------

    Runs a CPU stress test binary (stress-ng) on all cores of the
    platform.  While the all of the CPUs are loaded the GEOPM service
    is used to configure the Intel SST feature to give high priority
    to two cores (cores 0 and 5).  The CPU frequencies of the first 8
    cores on the system are printed before and after configuring SST
    core priority.
