'''The gffi module provides a wrapper around the cffi interface

This module enables a single cffi.FFI() object to be used throughout
all of the GEOPM python modules and also enables us to enforce that
the libgeopmpolicy.so dynamic library is opened prior to libgeopmd.so.
This is required because libgeopmd.so allocates static objects that
depend on static objects defined in libgeopmpolicy.so (in particular
the geopm::ApplicationSampler).
