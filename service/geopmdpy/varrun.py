        creation of an ActiveSessions object will make the directory
        if it does not exist.  This directory is created with
        restricted access permissions (mode: 0o700).

        If the path points to a symbolic link, the link will be
        renamed and a warning is printed to the syslog.  The directory

        display the target of the symbolic link and will appear in the
        syslog.

        if the directory is owned by the wrong user or group the

        session JSON schema, be owned by the geopmd user, and have
        restricted access permissions (mode: 0o600).  Files matching
        the session pattern which do not meet these criterion are not
        parsed, will be renamed, and a warning is printed to the
