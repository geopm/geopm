    Use in a for loop to execute a fixed number of timed delays.  The
    overhead time for executing what is inside of the loop is
    accounted for.  Calls to time.sleep() are made to delay until the
    targeted end time for each iteration.

    Example:

        >>> from time import time
        >>> time_0 = time()
        >>> for index in TimedLoop(0.1, 10):
        ...     print(f'{index}: {time() - time_0}')
